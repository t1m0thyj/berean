Ä(UWorld English BibleUusÜq(UGenesis(NU7In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.UàNow the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.U4God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.UUGod saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.UmGod called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.UnGod said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."UÜGod made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.URGod called the expanse sky. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.UwGod said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so.UqGod called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. God saw that it was good.U°God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth;" and it was so.U¢The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.U5There was evening and there was morning, a third day.UöGod said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;U\and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth;" and it was so.UÅGod made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.U>God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,Uqand to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.U6There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.UGod said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky."UªGod created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.U|God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."U5There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.UûGod said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;" and it was so.U™God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.U˘God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."UaGod created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them.U”God blessed them. God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth."UÆGod said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.U∑To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;" and it was so.UyGod saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.t(NUBThe heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array.UÅOn the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.UwGod blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work which he had created and made.UôThis is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens.U∂No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground,UObut a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.UÉYahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.U[Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.U…Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.UbA river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads.UtThe name of the first is Pishon: this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;UNand the gold of that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone.U`The name of the second river is Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.U|The name of the third river is Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.UXYahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.UVYahweh God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;UÉbut of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die."UjYahweh God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him."U◊Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.UûThe man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him.UÉYahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.UcHe made the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the man, into a woman, and brought her to the man.UÄThe man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."UnTherefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.UAThey were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.t(NU≥Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, "Has God really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"USThe woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,Uñbut of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"U5The serpent said to the woman, "You won't surely die,Uufor God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."UÁWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.UÖThe eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.U∑They heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.U?Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"UjThe man said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."UpGod said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"UZThe man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."UqYahweh God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."U”Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. On your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.UìI will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel."U∞To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."UÙTo Adam he said, "Because you have listened to your wife's voice, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake. In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.U\Thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of the field.UõBy the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."UFThe man called his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.UKYahweh God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.UµYahweh God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he put forth his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..."UhTherefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.U®So he drove out the man; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.t(NUuThe man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, "I have gotten a man with Yahweh's help."UnAgain she gave birth, to Cain's brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.UaAs time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.UlAbel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,Ufbut he didn't respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.UTYahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?UéIf you do well, will it not be lifted up? If you don't do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it."U†Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go into the field." It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.UfYahweh said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?" He said, "I don't know. Am I my brother's keeper?"U`Yahweh said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.UtNow you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.UÄFrom now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth."U?Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.U“Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."UßYahweh said to him, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should strike him.UQCain went out from Yahweh's presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.UèCain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.UçTo Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.UVLamech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.U\Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.UUHis brother's name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.UZillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal Cain's sister was Naamah.U©Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me.UGIf Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times."UïAdam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, "for God has appointed me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him."UcThere was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on Yahweh's name.t(NUlThis is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in God's likeness.UqHe created them male and female, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.U}Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.U}The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of sons and daughters.UJAll the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died.UBSeth lived one hundred five years, and became the father of Enosh.UvSeth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and became the father of sons and daughters.UBAll the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years, then he died.U9Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan.UzEnosh lived after he became the father of Kenan, eight hundred fifteen years, and became the father of sons and daughters.UAAll the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died.U>Kenan lived seventy years, and became the father of Mahalalel.UzKenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years, and became the father of sons and daughtersUDand all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then he died.UAMahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared.U|Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and became the father of sons and daughters.UMAll the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then he died.UHJared lived one hundred sixty-two years, and became the father of Enoch.UqJared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of sons and daughters.UFAll the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then he died.UBEnoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Methuselah.UÄEnoch walked with God after he became the father of Methuselah three hundred years, and became the father of sons and daughters.U:All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.U8Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.UQMethuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech.UÇMethuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of sons and daughters.ULAll the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, then he died.UJLamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of a son,Uìand he named him Noah, saying, "This same will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Yahweh has cursed."U|Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and became the father of sons and daughters.ULAll the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then he died.UVNoah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.t(NUfIt happened, when men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them,Usthat God's sons saw that men's daughters were beautiful, and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose.UÉYahweh said, "My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; yet will his days be one hundred twenty years."UƒThe Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when God's sons came in to men's daughters. They bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.UêYahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.UTYahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.UªYahweh said, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground; man, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them."U&But Noah found favor in Yahweh's eyes.UáThis is the history of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. Noah walked with God.U=Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.UIThe earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.UcGod saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.UõGod said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.UnMake a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch.UãThis is how you shall make it. The length of the ship will be three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.UµYou shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.U£I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die.UÇBut I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.UêOf every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.U∞Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.UsTake with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them."UBThus Noah did. According to all that God commanded him, so he did.t(NUÖYahweh said to Noah, "Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation.UôYou shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female.UsAlso of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth.U©In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. Every living thing that I have made, I will destroy from the surface of the ground."U.Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him.UJNoah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.UiNoah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, because of the waters of the flood.UZClean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything that creeps on the groundULwent by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah.UQIt happened after the seven days, that the waters of the flood came on the earth.UÀIn the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky's windows were opened.U6The rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.UñIn the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship;U¡they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.UWThey went to Noah into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them.UfThose who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; and Yahweh shut him in.UzThe flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.UlThe waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.UqThe waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.UKThe waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.UäAll flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man.UbAll in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.UÈEvery living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship.U9The waters prevailed on the earth one hundred fifty days.t(NUúGod remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided.UgThe deep's fountains and the sky's windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.UlThe waters receded from the earth continually. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.UaThe ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat's mountains.UçThe waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.U`It happened at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,Uaand he sent forth a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.U_He sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,U÷but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him into the ship; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship.USHe stayed yet another seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ship.UóThe dove came back to him at evening, and, behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth.UaHe stayed yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she didn't return to him any more.UÁIt happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried.UOIn the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.UGod spoke to Noah, saying,UV"Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.UÔBring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth."UGNoah went forth, with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him.U|Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.UÅNoah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.U˚Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again strike everything living, as I have done.U}While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."t(NUeGod blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.U…The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand.UfEvery moving thing that lives will be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you.U6But flesh with its life, its blood, you shall not eat.UªI will surely require your blood of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man.U\Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image.USBe fruitful and multiply. Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it."U3God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,UX"As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,U≤and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.U©I will establish my covenant with you: all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth."UìGod said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:U`I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.U`It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,U•and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.U´The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."U}God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."UgThe sons of Noah who went forth from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan.UQThese three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole earth was populated.U2Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.UEHe drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.U^Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.UÕShem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see their father's nakedness.UINoah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.ULHe said, "Canaan is cursed. He will be servant of servants to his brothers."UHHe said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem. Let Canaan be his servant.UXMay God enlarge Japheth. Let him dwell in the tents of Shem. Let Canaan be his servant."U5Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.UAAll the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, then he died.t(NUÖNow this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.UKThe sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.U3The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.U:The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.UÖOf these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.U0The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.UbThe sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.UKCush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.UiHe was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh."UXThe beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.USOut of that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,UAand Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).U?Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,UJPathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.U8Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,U*the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite,U#the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite,Ukthe Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.UçThe border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, to Lasha.UiThese are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.UnTo Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.U:The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.U,The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.UIArpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.UÄTo Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother's name was Joktan.UAJoktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,UHadoram, Uzal, Diklah,UObal, Abimael, Sheba,U=Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.UQTheir dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.UmThese are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, after their nations.UñThese are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations. Of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.t(NU6The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.UhIt happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.UÜThey said one to another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.U∫They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."UPYahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.UÆYahweh said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.UjCome, let's go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."UkSo Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.U´Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.UçThis is the history of the generations of Shem.

Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot.USHaran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.UùAbram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah.U#Sarai was barren. She had no child.UﬂTerah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife. They went forth from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.UCThe days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.t(NUåNow Yahweh said to Abram, "Get out of your country, and from your relatives, and from your father's house, to the land that I will show you.UeI will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.UÄI will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you. In you will all of the families of the earth be blessed."U~So Abram went, as Yahweh had spoken to him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.U‡Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother's son, all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. Into the land of Canaan they came.UoAbram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanite was then in the land.UÄYahweh appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to your seed." He built an altar there to Yahweh, who appeared to him.U¬He left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on the name of Yahweh.U0Abram traveled, going on still toward the South.UThere was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land.UéIt happened, when he had come near to enter Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.UâIt will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they will say, 'This is his wife.' They will kill me, but they will save you alive.UxPlease say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you."UeIt happened that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.UiThe princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.UÜHe dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.UWYahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.UuPharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this that you have done to me? Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife?UÄWhy did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way."UhPharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they brought him on the way with his wife and all that he had.t(NU\Abram went up out of Egypt: he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.U9Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.UÑHe went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,Ujto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.U@Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.UáThe land was not able to bear them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.U•There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.UáAbram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives.U∏Isn't the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."U”Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.UzSo Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.UpAbram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.UHNow the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.U™Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, "Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,URfor all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.UåI will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered.UZArise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth; for I will give it to you."UwAbram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.t(NUÉIt happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim,UÆthat they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).UMAll these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).UQTwelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.U∞In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,ULand the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.UùThey returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar.U’The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim;Uëagainst Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.UóNow the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills.UVThey took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.UVThey took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.U¨One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram.UùWhen Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.UëHe divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.UzHe brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.U≤The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).UYMelchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.U\He blessed him, and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:Uland blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand." Abram gave him a tenth of all.UVThe king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people, and take the goods to yourself."UsAbram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,U{that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'UÆI will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion."t(NUìAfter these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Don't be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward."UÇAbram said, "Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"UaAbram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."UîBehold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir, but he who will come forth out of your own body will be your heir."UüYahweh brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." He said to Abram, "So shall your seed be."UCHe believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.UmHe said to him, "I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it."U?He said, "Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?"UåHe said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."UÉHe brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn't divide the birds.UHThe birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.UcWhen the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him.U•He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.UdI will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth,UObut you will go to your fathers in peace.

Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.U§Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.UsHe went in to Hagar, and she conceived.

Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.UoNow Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.UlSarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"UaYahweh said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?'UIs anything too hard for Yahweh?

He said, "No, but you did laugh."UeThe men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.U1Yahweh said, "Will I hide from Abraham what I do,Uyseeing that Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?UÛFor I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him."UeYahweh said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,UvI will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me.

Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:UÖfor we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it."U–Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, "Get up!

Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city."U≥But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand, and his two daughters' hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.U¿It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, "Escape for your life! Don't look behind you, and don't stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!"U'Lot said to them, "Oh, not so, my lord.U—See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can't escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.UáSee now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one.

Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.U5The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.UWThen Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.UoHe overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.UJBut his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.URAbraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.UúHe looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.U∑It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.U°Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.UéThe firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.UjCome, let's make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed."UóThey made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father.

For the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, Isaac."UEThe thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.UÀGod said to Abraham, "Don't let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For from Isaac will your seed be called.UOI will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid, because he is your seed."U„Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.URThe water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.U¿She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, "Don't let me see the death of the child." She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.UΩGod heard the voice of the boy. The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, "What ails you, Hagar? Don't be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.UXGet up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation."UqGod opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink.UdGod was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.U]He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.UäIt happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do.U˚Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner."UAbraham said, "I will swear."UmAbraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.UwAbimelech said, "I don't know who has done this thing. Neither did you tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today."UUAbraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.U7Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.UaAbimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?"UxHe said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well."UHTherefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore there.UëSo they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.UjAbraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.UFAbraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.t(NUjIt happened after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!" He said, "Here I am."UæHe said, "Now take your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of."U›Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.UGOn the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.UÄAbraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will worship, and come back to you."UéAbraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together.U≠Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, "My father?" He said, "Here I am, my son." He said, "Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"UkAbraham said, "God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So they both went together.U©They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.UEAbraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.UeThe angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky, and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" He said, "Here I am."UßHe said, "Don't lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."U»Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.UÇAbraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide. As it is said to this day, "On Yahweh's mountain, it will be provided."UCThe angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out of the sky,UÄand said, "I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,Uøthat I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your seed will possess the gate of his enemies.U]In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."UrSo Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.UÖIt happened after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, "Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:U=Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,U-Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."UZBethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.UQHis concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.t(NUPSarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah's life.U}Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.UPAbraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,Uç"I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."U5The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,Uö"Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead."U[Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.UîHe talked with them, saying, "If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,U≥that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place."U¬Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,U£"No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."U9Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.UºHe spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, "But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there."U'Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,UÉ"My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead."U Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants' standard.U√So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deededUtto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.UÜAfter this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.UzThe field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth.t(NUTAbraham was old, and well stricken in age. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.UzAbraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, "Please put your hand under my thigh.U≠I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.UWBut you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac."UåThe servant said to him, "What if the woman isn't willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?"UEAbraham said to him, "Beware that you don't bring my son there again.T  Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, 'I will give this land to your seed.' He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.UÇIf the woman isn't willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath. Only you shall not bring my son there again."UhThe servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.UµThe servant took ten camels, of his master's camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master's with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.UÖHe made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.UxHe said, "Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.UpBehold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.T,  Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, 'Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,' and she will say, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,'--let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."UøIt happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.UîThe young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.UbThe servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher."UbShe said, "Drink, my lord." She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.UpWhen she had done giving him drink, she said, "I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking."UuShe hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.UsThe man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.U•It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,Uland said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?"UZShe said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."UZShe said moreover to him, "We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."U-The man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh.U”He said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of my master's relatives."UBThe young lady ran, and told her mother's house about these words.UWRebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.U˜It happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me," that he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.U|He said, "Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."U™The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.UpFood was set before him to eat, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told my message." He said, "Speak on."U!He said, "I am Abraham's servant.U©Yahweh has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.UgSarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him.UÄMy master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,UXbut you shall go to my father's house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.'U<I said to my master, 'What if the woman will not follow me?'U´He said to me, 'Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way.

If they don't give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.'UyI came this day to the spring, and said, 'Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go--Uºbehold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes forth to draw, to whom I will say, "Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink,"Uäand she will tell me, "Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,"--let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master's son.'U±Before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'U§She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.' So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.U∑I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.U¨I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.UÉNow if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."UdThen Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can't speak to you bad or good.UpBehold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as Yahweh has spoken."UhIt happened that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.U£The servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother.UíThey ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, "Send me away to my master."UtHer brother and her mother said, "Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go."UpHe said to them, "Don't hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."U6They said, "We will call the young lady, and ask her."UYThey called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" She said, "I will go."UUThey sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham's servant, and his men.U§They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, "Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them."UyRebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way.UQIsaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South.U~Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.URRebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel.UûShe said to the servant, "Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?" The servant said, "It is my master." She took her veil, and covered herself.U7The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.UñIsaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved her. Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.t(NU4Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.U?She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.UfJokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.UdThe sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.U&Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,Uïbut to the sons of Abraham's concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.UaThese are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.UvAbraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.UéIsaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,Uithe field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.UfIt happened after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.UÅNow this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.U¢These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,UMishma, Dumah, Massa,U)Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.UíThese are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.UãThese are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.UtThey lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.UcThis is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.UíIsaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.UyIsaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.UrThe children struggled together within her. She said, "If it be so, why do I live?" She went to inquire of Yahweh.U∏Yahweh said to her, Two nations are in your womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.USWhen her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.UKThe first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.UâAfter that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.UfThe boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.UFNow Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.UDJacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.UtEsau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom.U-Jacob said, "First, sell me your birthright."UJEsau said, "Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?"URJacob said, "Swear to me first." He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.UxJacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.t(NUîThere was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.UdYahweh appeared to him, and said, "Don't go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.U¿Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.UôI will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,Ufbecause Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."UIsaac lived in Gerar.UŸThe men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "My wife," lest, he thought, "the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at."U¨It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.U´Abimelech called Isaac, and said, "Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, 'She is my sister?'" Isaac said to him, "Because I said, 'Lest I die because of her.'"UîAbimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!"UnAbimelech commanded all the people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death."UlIsaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Yahweh blessed him.UFThe man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.UfHe had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.UåNow all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.UIAbimelech said to Isaac, "Go from us, for you are much mightier than we."ULIsaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.UÂIsaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.UNIsaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.UñThe herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.URThey dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah.U∂He left that place, and dug another well. They didn't argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, "For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land."U#He went up from there to Beersheba.U≈Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, "I am the God of Abraham your father. Don't be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham's sake."UyHe built an altar there, and called on the name of Yahweh, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac's servants dug a well.UcThen Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.UaIsaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?"U°They said, "We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,U´that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.' You are now the blessed of Yahweh."U-He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.U{They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.UíIt happened the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water."UMHe called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.UâWhen Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.U+They grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits.t(NU¨It happened, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, "My son?" He said to him, "Here I am."U>He said, "See now, I am old. I don't know the day of my death.UpNow therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.UvMake me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die."UlRebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.UhRebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, "Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,Ui'Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.'UKNow therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.UÜGo now to the flock, and get me from there two good kids of the goats. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves.U_You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death."UaJacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.UyWhat if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing."UfHis mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me."UmHe went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.URebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.UWShe put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.U_She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.UXHe came to his father, and said, "My father?"

Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me."UÅIsaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" He said, "Because Yahweh your God gave me success."UpIsaac said to Jacob, "Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not."U~Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."UiHe didn't recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau's hands. So he blessed him.U7He said, "Are you really my son Esau?" He said, "I am."U©He said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you." He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.UCHis father Isaac said to him, "Come near now, and kiss me, my son."U∞He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, "Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.UbGod give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.U¿Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers. Let your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you. Blessed be everyone who blesses you."U≥It happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.U†He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, "Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me."U\Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?"

Yes, he will be blessed."UñWhen Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, my father."UKHe said, "Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing."U…He said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing." He said, "Haven't you reserved a blessing for me?"U√Isaac answered Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What then will I do for you, my son?"UáEsau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father." Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.UÄIsaac his father answered him, "Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above.UõBy your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother. It will happen, when you will break loose, that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck."U∏Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, "The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob."U√The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.UQNow therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran.U?Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away;U¥until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"UÀRebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?"t(NUjIsaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.UíArise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.UjMay God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,Uîand give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham."UÄIsaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah's brother, Jacob's and Esau's mother.U‹Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,"UMand that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram.UFEsau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn't please Isaac, his father.UóEsau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.U5Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.U∏He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.UãHe dreamed. Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.UØBehold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, "I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed.UœYour seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.U¥Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you."UeJacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, "Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I didn't know it."U{He was afraid, and said, "How dreadful is this place! This is none other than God's house, and this is the gate of heaven."UçJacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top.UWHe called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.UíJacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,UNso that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God,Uäthen this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God's house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you."t(NUQThen Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.U∏He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well's mouth was large.U°There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in its place.UWJacob said to them, "My relatives, where are you from?" They said, "We are from Haran."UQHe said to them, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?" They said, "We know him."UuHe said to them, "Is it well with him?" They said, "It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep."UáHe said, "Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them."UäThey said, "We can't, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep."U\While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.UÙIt happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.U7Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.UoJacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. She ran and told her father.U¿It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.UVLaban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. He lived with him for a month.ULaban said to Jacob, "Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?"U`Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.UGLeah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.U^Jacob loved Rachel. He said, "I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter."UlLaban said, "It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me."UdJacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.U[Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her."UCLaban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.UfIt happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her.UCLaban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.UÆIt happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. He said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Didn't I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"UVLaban said, "It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.UÜFulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years."UNJacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.UKLaban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her handmaid.UnHe went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.UNYahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.UñLeah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, "Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction. For now my husband will love me."UôShe conceived again, and bore a son, and said, "Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also." She named him Simeon.U§She conceived again, and bore a son. Said, "Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore was his name called Levi.UâShe conceived again, and bore a son. She said, "This time will I praise Yahweh." Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.t(NUÖWhen Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I will die."U~Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, "Am I in God's place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"UwShe said, "Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her."UCShe gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went in to her.U'Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.UyRachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son." Therefore called she his name Dan.UHBilhah, Rachel's handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.UqRachel said, "With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed." She named him Naphtali.UlWhen Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.U*Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a son.U.Leah said, "How fortunate!" She named him Gad.U1Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a second son.USLeah said, "Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy." She named him Asher.U∫Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."U She said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes, also?" Rachel said, "Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes."UΩJacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, "You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes." He lay with her that night.UDGod listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.UhLeah said, "God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband." She named him Issachar.U4Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.UéLeah said, "God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons." She named him Zebulun.U5Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.UDGod remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.UFShe conceived, bore a son, and said, "God has taken away my reproach."UAShe named him Joseph, saying, "May Yahweh add another son to me."UÖIt happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.UÇGive me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you."UÑLaban said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake."U5He said, "Appoint me your wages, and I will give it."U[He said to him, "You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.U≠For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?"UöHe said, "What shall I give you?" Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.U∆I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.UÌSo my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be counted stolen."U?Laban said, "Behold, I desire it to be according to your word."UÌThat day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.U_He set three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.UéJacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.U¶He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.UcThe flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.U¿Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn't put them into Laban's flock.U©It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;Umbut when the flock were feeble, he didn't put them in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.UoThe man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.t(NUûHe heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's. From that which was our father's, has he gotten all this wealth."UWJacob saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.UjYahweh said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you."U@Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,Uçand said to them, "I see the expression on your father's face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.U@You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.UaYour father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn't allow him to hurt me.U´If he said this, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, 'The streaked will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked.UFThus God has taken away your father's livestock, and given them to me.U™It happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.UKThe angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.'U©He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.UúI am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"UdRachel and Leah answered him, "Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?UdAren't we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.UäFor all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."UAThen Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,U¿and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.U\Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.UUJacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn't tell him that he was running away.UsSo he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.U4Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.UuHe took his relatives with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.UíGod came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad."UåLaban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.U~Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?UòWhy did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;URand didn't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.UØIt is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.'UoNow, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?"UpJacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.'U§Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it." For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.U≤Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn't find them. He went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.UàNow Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt about all the tent, but didn't find them.U¢She said to her father, "Don't let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for the manner of women is on me." He searched, but didn't find the teraphim.UâJacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, "What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?U∑Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.UêThese twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks.UçThat which was torn of animals, I didn't bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.UrThis was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.U®These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.U⁄Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."UÈLaban answered Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?U]Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you."U/Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.UlJacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones." They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.U<Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.U]Laban said, "This heap is witness between me and you this day." Therefore it was named GaleedU_and Mizpah, for he said, "Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.UÜIf you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you."U]Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.UØMay this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.UàThe God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.UáJacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.UáEarly in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.t(NU5Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.U^When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God's army." He called the name of that place Mahanaim.UcJacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.U≠He commanded them, saying, "This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: 'This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.UáI have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.'"UëThe messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him."UùThen Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;Uland he said, "If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape."U£Jacob said, "God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, 'Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,'UÕI am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.UîPlease deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children.UÖYou said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can't be numbered because there are so many.'"UfHe lodged there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother:UQtwo hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,U_thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.UüHe delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd."UùHe commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, 'Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?'U{Then you shall say, 'They are your servant, Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.'"UéHe commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.U÷You shall say, 'Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.'" For, he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."UTSo the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the camp.UÇHe rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.UMHe took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.URJacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.UëWhen he saw that he didn't prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled.UeThe man said, "Let me go, for the day breaks." Jacob said, "I won't let you go, unless you bless me."U6He said to him, "What is your name?" He said, "Jacob."UHe said, "Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed."UuJacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." He said, "Why is it that you ask what my name is?" He blessed him there.UrJacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."UQThe sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.U∫Therefore the children of Israel don't eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.t(NUßJacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids.UqHe put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.UxHe himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.UPEsau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.U¢He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, "Who are these with you?" He said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."ULThen the handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.UÄLeah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.UsEsau said, "What do you mean by all this company which I met?" Jacob said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."UIEsau said, "I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours."UøJacob said, "Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.UèPlease take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." He urged him, and he took it.UNEsau said, "Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you."U¥Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.U“Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir."UÉEsau said, "Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me." He said, "Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."U-So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.UâJacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.UàJacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.UïHe bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money.U9He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.t(NU_Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.UqShechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.UqHis soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.UOShechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, "Get me this young lady as a wife."UëNow Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came.U?Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.U‘The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; a which thing ought not to be done.UxHamor talked with them, saying, "The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.UYMake marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.UkYou shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it."U{Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give.UqAsk me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife."UzThe sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,Uxand said to them, "We can't do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.UoOnly on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;Uâthen will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.UhBut if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our sister, and we will be gone."U3Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.UçThe young man didn't wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father.UjHamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,U’"These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.UòOnly on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.UéWon't their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us."UùAll who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.UøIt happened on the third day, when they were sore, that two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males.UyThey killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away.U]Jacob's sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.UlThey took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,UÑand all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house.T  Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house."UAThey said, "Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?"t(NUûGod said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother."UóThen Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.UöLet us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."U°They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.UuThey traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn't pursue the sons of Jacob.UpSo Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.UãHe built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.UtDeborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.ULGod appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him.UÄGod said to him, "Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel." He named him Israel.UòGod said to him, "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body.UtThe land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give the land."U:God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.UäJacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.UEJacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him "Bethel."UvThey traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor.UjWhen she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for now you will have another son."UtIt happened, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin.UJRachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).UYJacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.U>Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.U¶It happened, while Israel lived in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it.

Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.UÅNow Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors.UÅHis brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn't speak peaceably to him.UXJoseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more.U>He said to them, "Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:Ußfor behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf."U¢His brothers said to him, "Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us?" They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words.U¥He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, "Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me."U‚He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?"UAHis brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.U:His brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.UãIsrael said to Joseph, "Aren't your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." He said to him, "Here I am."U∫He said to him, "Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again." So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.UrA certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, "What are you looking for?"U[He said, "I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock."UãThe man said, "They have left here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.U_They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.U6They said one to another, "Behold, this dreamer comes.U´Come now therefore, and let's kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, 'An evil animal has devoured him.' We will see what will become of his dreams."UZReuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, "Let's not take his life."UªReuben said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him"--that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.U~It happened, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;U[and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.U‘They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.U\Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?UçCome, and let's sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh." His brothers listened to him.UªMidianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Joseph into Egypt.U[Reuben returned to the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn't in the pit; and he tore his clothes.UVHe returned to his brothers, and said, "The child is no more; and I, where will I go?"URThey took Joseph's coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.UûThey took the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, "We have found this. Examine it, now, whether it is your son's coat or not."U{He recognized it, and said, "It is my son's coat. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces."UZJacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days.UÆAll his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, "For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning." His father wept for him.UbThe Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.t(NUyIt happened at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.UgJudah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her.U3She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er.U<She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan.UXShe yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.U@Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.ULEr, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Yahweh. Yahweh killed him.UäJudah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed to your brother."U´Onan knew that the seed wouldn't be his; and it happened, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.UOThe thing which he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and he killed him also.U⁄Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;" for he said, "Lest he also die, like his brothers." Tamar went and lived in her father's house.U§After many days, Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.UaIt was told Tamar, saying, "Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."UÙShe took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn't given to him as a wife.UWWhen Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.U¿He turned to her by the way, and said, "Please come, let me come in to you," for he didn't know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"UwHe said, "I will send you a kid of the goats from the flock." She said, "Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?"U∂He said, "What pledge will I give you?" She said, "Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand." He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.UbShe arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.UèJudah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, but he didn't find her.UïThen he asked the men of her place, saying, "Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?" They said, "There has been no prostitute here."UHe returned to Judah, and said, "I haven't found her; and also the men of the place said, 'There has been no prostitute here.'"UeJudah said, "Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this kid, and you haven't found her."UÌIt happened about three months later, that it was told Judah, saying, "Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute; and moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution." Judah said, "Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."UÕWhen she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "By the man, whose these are, I am with child." She also said, "Please discern whose are these--the signet, and the cords, and the staff."UäJudah acknowledged them, and said, "She is more righteous than I, because I didn't give her to Shelah, my son." He knew her again no more.ULIt happened in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb.UÇWhen she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This came out first."UßIt happened, as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out, and she said, "Why have you made a breach for yourself?" Therefore his name was called Perez.UgAfterward his brother came out, that had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.t(NU∏Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.UdYahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.UbHis master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.UâJoseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.UÈIt happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Yahweh was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.UòHe left all that he had in Joseph's hand. He didn't concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. Joseph was well-built and handsome.UlIt happened after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, "Lie with me."UôBut he refused, and said to his master's wife, "Behold, my master doesn't know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.U≤He isn't greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"U]As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn't listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.UkAbout this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.UgShe caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!" He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.UKWhen she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,U¥she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, "Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.UqIt happened, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."U;She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.U~She spoke to him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,Ueand it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."UúIt happened, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your servant did to me," that his wrath was kindled.UÑJoseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.UtBut Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.UëThe keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.UòThe keeper of the prison didn't look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.t(NUzIt happened after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt.UQPharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.UsHe put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.UlThe captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days.U√They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.UPJoseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad.UwHe asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, saying, "Why do you look so sad today?"U®They said to him, "We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it." Joseph said to them, "Don't interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me."UoThe chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,UÖand in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.UÇPharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."USJoseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.UØWithin three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cupbearer.UìBut remember me when it will be well with you, and show kindness, please, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.UäFor indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."U†When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, "I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.U|In the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head."UOJoseph answered, "This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days.UíWithin three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you."U»It happened the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.U_He restored the chief cupbearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand;UAbut he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.U?Yet the chief cupbearer didn't remember Joseph, but forgot him.t(NUbIt happened at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river.UdBehold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass.UáBehold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river.UQThe ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.UlHe slept and dreamed a second time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good.UXBehold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.UpThe thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.U“It happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt's magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.UOThen the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I remember my faults today.U|Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.UlWe dreamed a dream in one night, I and he. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.UºThere was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to his dream he interpreted.UaIt happened, as he interpreted to us, so it was: he restored me to my office, and he hanged him."UñThen Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.U©Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."U\Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, "It isn't in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."UQPharaoh spoke to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river:Udand behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh grass,Uäand behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.U;The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle,Uäand when they had eaten them up, it couldn't be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.UXI saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good:Ugand behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.UëThe thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."UiJoseph said to Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.UkThe seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one.UØThe seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.U\That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh.UPBehold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.UèThere will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,Urand the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.UqThe dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.U`"Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.UôLet Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt's produce in the seven plenteous years.UîLet them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.UùThe food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine."UOThe thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.UcPharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?"UjPharaoh said to Joseph, "Because God has shown you all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as you.UÉYou shall be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you."ULPharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."UôPharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck,Uâand he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, "Bow the knee!" He set him over all the land of Egypt.U{Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."U°Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.U†Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.U@In the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly.UøHe gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was around every city, he laid up in the same.UmJoseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.UTo Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.UÇJoseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."UgThe name of the second, he called Ephraim: "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."UJThe seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end.UéThe seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.UüWhen all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do."UúThe famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.UgAll countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.t(NUjNow Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?"UâHe said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die."U8Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.UtBut Jacob didn't send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers; for he said, "Lest perhaps harm happen to him."U^The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.U∞Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph's brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.UŒJoseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, "Where did you come from?" They said, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."U>Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn't recognize him.UåJoseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land."UHThey said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.UKWe are all one man's sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies."UJHe said to them, "No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land."U©They said, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more."UEJoseph said to them, "It is like I told you, saying, 'You are spies.'UBy this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go forth from here, unless your youngest brother comes here.U∫Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies."U5He put them all together into custody for three days.UFJoseph said to them the third day, "Do this, and live, for I fear God.UÑIf you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.UcBring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won't die." They did so.U…They said one to another, "We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn't listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us."U°Reuben answered them, saying, "Didn't I tell you, saying, 'Don't sin against the child,' and you wouldn't listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required."UXThey didn't know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.UöHe turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.U§Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.UDThey loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.UáAs one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.UæHe said to his brothers, "My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!" Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"UkThey came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,U\"The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.U4We said to him, 'We are honest men. We are no spies.UÄWe are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'UªThe man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.U≤Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.'"U´It happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.U¥Jacob, their father, said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me."UèReuben spoke to his father, saying, "Kill my two sons, if I don't bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again."UŒHe said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."t(NU"The famine was severe in the land.UîIt happened, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again, buy us a little more food."U~Judah spoke to him, saying, "The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'UCIf you'll send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy you food,UÖbut if you'll not send him, we'll not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'"U[Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?"T  They said, "The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down?'"UüJudah said to Israel, his father, "Send the boy with me, and we'll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.UóI'll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don't bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever,UNfor if we hadn't delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now."U‰Their father, Israel, said to them, "If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;UÜand take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.U6Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.UúMay God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."UãThe men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.U∂When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and make ready; for the men will dine with me at noon."UOThe man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph's house.T  The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, "Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we're brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys."U`They came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,UGand said, "Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.U≤When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.UhWe have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don't know who put our money in our sacks."UÆHe said, "Peace be to you. Don't be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money." He brought Simeon out to them.U{The man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.UiThey made ready the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.UäWhen Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him to the earth.UpHe asked them of their welfare, and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?"UgThey said, "Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive." They bowed the head, and did homage.U∂He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?" He said, "God be gracious to you, my son."UÄJoseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there.UTHe washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, "Serve the meal."UÕThey served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians don't eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.UèThey sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled one with another.UéHe sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.t(NUôHe commanded the steward of his house, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.UåPut my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, with his grain money." He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.UQAs soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.UºWhen they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, "Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, 'Why have you rewarded evil for good?UlIsn't this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.'"U3He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.U}They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!U¨Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord's house?UdWith whoever of your servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondservants."UÇHe said, "Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my bondservant; and you will be blameless."UaThen they hurried, and every man took his sack down to the ground, and every man opened his sack.UiHe searched, beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin's sack.UXThen they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.UjJudah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him.UsJoseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Don't you know that such a man as I can indeed divine?"UÈJudah said, "What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord's bondservants, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found."U£He said, "Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my bondservant; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."UΩThen Judah came near to him, and said, "Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and don't let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.UFMy lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?'U¥We said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.'UQYou said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'UnWe said to my lord, 'The boy can't leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'UlYou said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.'UXIt happened when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.U2Our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.'U°We said, 'We can't go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man's face, unless our youngest brother is with us.'UMYour servant, my father, said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons:Ufand the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces;" and I haven't seen him since.UtIf you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.'UÑNow therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the boy's life;Ußit will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die.

No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.UCHe wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.UëJoseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Does my father still live?" His brothers couldn't answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.UÜJoseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please." They came near. "He said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.UtNow don't be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.UÜFor these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.UpGod sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.UîSo now it wasn't you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.UëHurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says, "God has made me lord of all Egypt.

You shall hurry and bring my father down here."UPHe fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.UVHe kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.UÄThe report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come." It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.UoPharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan.UèTake your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.'UèNow you are commanded: do this. Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.UiAlso, don't concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours."UÅThe sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.UÇHe gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.U∑To his father, he sent after this manner: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.UjSo he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, "See that you don't quarrel on the way."USThey went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father.UäThey told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt." His heart fainted, for he didn't believe them.U®They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.U^Israel said, "It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."t(NUtIsrael traveled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac.U`God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, "Jacob, Jacob!" He said, "Here I am."UHe said, "I am God, the God of your father. Don't be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation.UhI will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph will close your eyes."U®Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.UèThey took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt--Jacob, and all his seed with him,Uhis sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and he brought all his seed with him into Egypt.UrThese are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.U5The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.U_The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.U.The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.UãThe sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.

All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.UpHe sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen.UßJoseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.U_Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive."U«Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, "I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, 'My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.UèThese men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.'URIt will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, 'What is your occupation?'U›that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."t(NU‘Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, "My father and my brothers, with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen."UHFrom among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.UáPharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" They said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers."UÔThey said to Pharaoh, "We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."UQPharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.U◊The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock."U[Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.UIPharaoh said to Jacob, "How many are the days of the years of your life?"T  Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."UAJacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.U¶Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.UvJoseph nourished his father, his brothers, and all of his father's household, with bread, according to their families.UïThere was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.U¥Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.U«When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, "Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails."UjJoseph said, "Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone."UËThey brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.UˇWhen that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.U‹Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won't be desolate."U•So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh's.UoAs for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.UØOnly he didn't buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn't sell their land.UïThen Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.UœIt will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."UtThey said, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."U¢Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's.UïIsrael lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.UÇJacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.UËThe time drew near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don't bury me in Egypt,Uébut when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place." He said, "I will do as you have said."UTHe said, "Swear to me," and he swore to him. Israel bowed himself on the bed's head.t(NUêIt happened after these things, that someone said to Joseph, "Behold, your father is sick." He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.UzSomeone told Jacob, and said, "Behold, your son Joseph comes to you," and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.U`Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,U¿and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.'U¶Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.UéYour issue, who you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.U’As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem)."U4Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, "Who are these?"UÖJoseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." He said, "Please bring them to me, and I will bless them."UÖNow the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn't see. He brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.UmIsrael said to Joseph, "I didn't think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your seed also."U`Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.U£Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.UªIsrael stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.UçHe blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,U«the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."U±When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.UkJoseph said to his father, "Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."U◊His father refused, and said, "I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations."UèHe blessed them that day, saying, "In you will Israel bless, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh'" He set Ephraim before Manasseh.UvIsrael said to Joseph, "Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.UâMoreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."t(NUáJacob called to his sons, and said: "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come.UPAssemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob.

There were lice on man, and on animal.UñThen the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God:" and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.U«Yahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes forth to the water; and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh says, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.U˚Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.U∂I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the earth.U[I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be."'"U∆Yahweh did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.UZPharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!"UﬁMoses said, "It isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God. Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and won't they stone us?UmWe will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as he shall command us."UëPharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away.

There remained not one.UKPharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he didn't let the people go.t(NUöThen Yahweh said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me.U6For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still,U∂behold, the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.U®Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the children of Israel."'"UWYahweh appointed a set time, saying, "Tomorrow Yahweh shall do this thing in the land."UâYahweh did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died.U®Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn't let the people go.UìYahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.UùIt shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt."U®They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal.U~The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.UbYahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.UªYahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me.U¨For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.UáFor now I would have put forth my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;UÅbut indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth;UJas you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't let them go.UôBehold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.UÓNow therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter.

Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.UâSo there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.U∞The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.UQOnly in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.UéPharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time.

See, evil is clearly before your faces.U}Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you desire!" They were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.U¬Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left."UæMoses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.U¬The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.T  For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.UwThen Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, "I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.UwNow therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to Yahweh your God, that he may also take away from me this death."U/He went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.U£Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.UQBut Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go.UëYahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt."UrMoses stretched forth his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.UêThey didn't see one another, neither did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.UéPharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve Yahweh. Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind.

There shall not a hoof be left behind, for of it we must take to serve Yahweh our God; and we don't know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we come there."UABut Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let them go.UyPharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!"UGMoses said, "You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more."t(NUØYahweh said to Moses, "Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go.

Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.U]Moses said, "This is what Yahweh says: 'About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt,U”and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock.UoThere shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.UæBut against any of the children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.UÀAll these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, "Get out, with all the people who follow you;" and after that I will go out.'" He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.UlYahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh won't listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."UóMoses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go out of his land.t(NU=Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,Ud"This month shall be to you the beginning of months.

There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them;T+  and he said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you."U{They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.t(NUÓThey took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.UlThe whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;T  and the children of Israel said to them, "We wish that we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger."UÕThen said Yahweh to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.UéIt shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily."UåMoses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, "At evening, then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt;Uïand in the morning, then you shall see the glory of Yahweh; because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh. Who are we, that you murmur against us?"U˜Moses said, "Now Yahweh shall give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh."UàMoses said to Aaron, "Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, 'Come near before Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.'"UØIt happened, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.UYahweh spoke to Moses, saying,U—"I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, 'At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread: and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.'"UoIt happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.UÉWhen the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.U∂When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, "What is it?" For they didn't know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat."U”This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded: "Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent."UAThe children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.U£When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating.U?Moses said to them, "Let no one leave of it until the morning."UûNotwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them.UhThey gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.UòIt happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.T  He said to them, "This is that which Yahweh has spoken, 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.'"UoThey laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it didn't become foul, neither was there any worm in it.UhMoses said, "Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in the field.U`Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none."U`It happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.URYahweh said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?U¿Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day."U(So the people rested on the seventh day.U{The house of Israel called its name Manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.UÓMoses said, "This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, 'Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.'"UåMoses said to Aaron, "Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations."UPAs Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.U†The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.U*Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.t(NU”All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to Yahweh's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink.UòTherefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?"UΩThe people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"UfMoses cried to Yahweh, saying, "What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."UüYahweh said to Moses, "Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.UƒBehold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink." Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.U§He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying, "Is Yahweh among us, or not?"U4Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.UëMoses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God's rod in my hand."UvSo Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.UqIt happened, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.U⁄But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset.UAJoshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.U©Yahweh said to Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky."U<Moses built an altar, and called its name Yahweh our Banner.U[He said, "Yah has sworn: 'Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.'"t(NU≠Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.UYJethro, Moses' father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,Usand her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land".UtThe name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, "My father's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword."UâJethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God.UkHe said to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.UàMoses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.UªMoses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them.UÖJethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.UªJethro said, "Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.UrNow I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them."U´Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.UÉIt happened on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.U…When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, "What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?"URMoses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God.UéWhen they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws."UEMoses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you do is not good.UôYou will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.UáListen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God.UÑYou shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.UﬁMoreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.UﬂLet them judge the people at all times.

So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you.UìIf you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all of these people also will go to their place in peace."URSo Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.UúMoses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.UzThey judged the people at all times. They brought the hard causes to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.UJMoses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.t(NUëIn the third month after the children of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.UûWhen they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain.UùMoses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain, saying, "This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:Uk'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.UùNow therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;UÜand you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.'

Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.UøYahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever." Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.UpYahweh said to Moses, "Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,U}and be ready against the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.U∫You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, 'Be careful that you don't go up onto the mountain, or touch its border.

Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.UtYahweh said to Moses, "Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.UeLet the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break forth on them."UéMoses said to Yahweh, "The people can't come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, 'Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.'"UÆYahweh said to him, "Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you, but don't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he break forth on them."U0So Moses went down to the people, and told them.t(NU"God spoke all these words, saying,U]"I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.U'You shall have no other gods before me.U≠"You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:Uÿyou shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me,UWand showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.U{"You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain, for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.U+"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.U/You shall labor six days, and do all your work,UÁbut the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God.

They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'"U\Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.UãNow therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."UøMoses begged Yahweh his God, and said, "Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?UÂWhy should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'He brought them forth for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?' Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.T  Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.'"UDYahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.UƒMoses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.UaThe tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.UuWhen Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is the noise of war in the camp."UßHe said, "It isn't the voice of those who shout for victory, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear."U¬It happened, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses' anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.UûHe took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.UbMoses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?"UeAaron said, "Don't let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.UØFor they said to me, 'Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.'UãI said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:' so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."UsWhen Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),Uòthen Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is on Yahweh's side, come to me!" All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.UıHe said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.'"UtThe sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.UúMoses said, "Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day."U£It happened on the next day, that Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin."UtMoses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.UmYet now, if you will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written."UUYahweh said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.U≥Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin."UGYahweh struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.t(NUﬁYahweh spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.'UìI will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:Uìto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you in the way."URWhen the people heard this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on his jewelry.UÓYahweh said to Moses, "Tell the children of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up into your midst for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.'"UTThe children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.UÍNow Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it "The Tent of Meeting." It happened that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.U™It happened that when Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent.UáIt happened, when Moses entered into the Tent, that the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses.UåAll the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door.UµYahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn't depart out of the Tent.UœMoses said to Yahweh, "Behold, you tell me, 'Bring up this people:' and you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'UΩNow therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people."UBHe said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."URHe said to him, "If your presence doesn't go with me, don't carry us up from here.U€For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn't it in that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?"UÖYahweh said to Moses, "I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."U%He said, "Please show me your glory."U∆He said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."UCHe said, "You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live."USYahweh also said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock.UçIt will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;UXthen I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen."t(NUöYahweh said to Moses, "Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.UÄBe ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.UìNo one shall come up with you; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain."UπHe chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.U[Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.UîYahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, "Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,T  keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, on the third and on the fourth generation."UAMoses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.UœHe said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."T  He said, "Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.UüObserve that which I command you this day. Behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.UÜBe careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you:Unbut you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherim;UXfor you shall worship no other god: for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.U≥Don't make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;U†and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods.U,You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.U≈"You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread.

He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.UËIt happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mountain, that Moses didn't know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.UWhen Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.UpMoses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.UàAfterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.UBWhen Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.U≤But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.UôThe children of Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.t(NUõMoses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, "These are the words which Yahweh has commanded, that you should do them.UÆ'Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh: whoever does any work in it shall be put to death.UJYou shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day.'"UyMoses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which Yahweh commanded, saying,UÑ'Take from among you an offering to Yahweh.

he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you: so you shall drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you.U˛Don't speak in your heart, after that Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh does drive them out from before you.T-  Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.UçKnow therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.U÷Remember, don't forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.UYAlso in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.U‰When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.UÈYahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.UàIt came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.U¯Yahweh said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence; for your people whom you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.UiFurthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:Uílet me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.UçSo I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.U©I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God; you had made you a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.UbI took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.UÈI fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.UîFor I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also.U^Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.U“I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.URAt Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked Yahweh to wrath.U÷When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn't believe him, nor listen to his voice.UEYou have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you.U|So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.U∆I prayed to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, don't destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.UåRemember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,U“lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.UvYet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.t(NUÖAt that time Yahweh said to me, Cut two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood.UvI will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.UçSo I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tables of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tables in my hand.UÃHe wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Yahweh gave them to me.UÑI turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me.U¥(The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his place.U`From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.U≠At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.UáTherefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God spoke to him.)UîI stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Yahweh listened to me that time also; Yahweh would not destroy you.UôYahweh said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.U∆Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul,Uato keep the commandments of Yahweh, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?UiBehold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.UáOnly Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.UMCircumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.UîFor Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn't regard persons, nor takes reward.UoHe does execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.UKTherefore love the foreigner;

[They are] a perverse and crooked generation.UÖDo you thus requite Yahweh, foolish people and unwise? Isn't he your father who has bought you? He has made you, and established you.UçRemember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.U¥When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.UHFor Yahweh's portion is his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.UâHe found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness. He surrounded him. He cared for him. He kept him as the apple of his eye.UâAs an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young, he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them on his feathers.U8Yahweh alone led him. There was no foreign god with him.UúHe made him ride on the high places of the earth. He ate the increase of the field. He caused him to suck honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;U≠Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat. Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.UµBut Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.U]They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]. They provoked him to anger with abominations.UìThey sacrificed to demons, [which were] no God, to gods that they didn't know, to new [gods] that came up of late, which your fathers didn't dread.UaOf the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful, and have forgotten God who gave you birth.U_Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them], because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.UôHe said, I will hide my face from them. I will see what their end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.U‡They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities. I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.UïFor a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.U:I will heap evils on them. I will spend my arrows on them.U¥[They shall be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of animals on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.UÇOutside the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers, terror; on both young man and virgin, The suckling with the gray-haired man.U[I said, I would scatter them afar. I would make the memory of them to cease from among men;U≠were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, Yahweh has not done all this.UIFor they are a nation void of counsel. There is no understanding in them.U]Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!UÜHow could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had delivered them up?ULFor their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.U~For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter.U>Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.UBIsn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?U¶Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand. The things that are to come on them shall make haste.U§For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that [their] power is gone, There is none [remaining], shut up or left at large.UFHe will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge;UéWhich ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you! Let them be your protection.UñSee now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me. I kill, and I make alive. I wound, and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.U<For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,Uèif I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense those who hate me.UúI will make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy.UπRejoice, you nations, [with] his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people.UhMoses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.U<Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;U´He said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.U•For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.U,Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,U√Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession;Uëand die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:UÕbecause you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel.UtFor you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.t(NUfThis is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.U∂He said, Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them.

Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.UúTheir children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.UÇIt happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed.UñYahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you." Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.UâThe children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.U{They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.U¿The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel didn't have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.UËIt happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"U∞He said, "No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh's army." Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"UàThe prince of Yahweh's army said to Joshua, "Take your shoes off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy." Joshua did so.t(NUgNow Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in.UoYahweh said to Joshua, "Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the mighty men of valor.UhAll your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once.

March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh's ark."U’It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.U|The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as they went.U√Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout."UÄSo he caused the ark of Yahweh to go around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.ULJoshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh.UÙThe seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them. The rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh. The trumpets sounded as they went.UeThe second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.U√It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.UäIt happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for Yahweh has given you the city!U¬The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.UπBut as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.UyBut all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Yahweh. They shall come into Yahweh's treasury."T   So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets. It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.UìThey utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.U¶Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."U÷The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.U§They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house.UŒBut Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.T  Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed be the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."U<So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.t(NUˇBut the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore Yahweh's anger burned against the children of Israel.UµJoshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, "Go up and spy out the land." The men went up and spied out Ai.U”They returned to Joshua, and said to him, "Don't let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Don't make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them."U\So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.U∆The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them, and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water.U•Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.U⁄Joshua said, "Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan!UZOh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!U©For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?"UJYahweh said to Joshua, "Get up! Why are you fallen on your face like that?UﬁIsrael has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Tes, they have even taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own stuff.U˜Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.T   Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, "Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'There is a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.'T  In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the tribe which Yahweh selects shall come near by families. The family which Yahweh selects shall come near by households. The household which Yahweh selects shall come near man by man.U÷It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel."UpSo Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was selected.U°He brought near the family of Judah; and he selected the family of the Zerahites. He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected.UèHe brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.U¢Joshua said to Achan, "My son, please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to him. Tell me now what you have done! Don't hide it from me!"UvAchan answered Joshua, and said, "I have truly sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and this is what I have done.T   When I saw among the spoil a beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. Behold, they are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under it."UqSo Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.UåThey took them from the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel. They laid them down before Yahweh.UÛJoshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.U®Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day. All Israel stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.UƒThey raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called "The valley of Achor" to this day.t(NU◊Yahweh said to Joshua, "Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, with his people, his city, and his land.UªYou shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king, except its spoil and its livestock, you shall take for a plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it."UíSo Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night.UòHe commanded them, saying, "Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Don't go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.U°I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.U•They will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, 'They flee before us, like the first time.' So we will flee before them,U{and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.U•It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do this according to the word of Yahweh. Behold, I have commanded you."U¢Joshua sent them out; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua stayed among the people that night.U|Joshua rose up early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.UπAll the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.UlHe took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.UÆSo they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.T  It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.UeJoshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.UÜAll the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.UvThere was not a man left in Ai or Beth El who didn't go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued Israel.U∫Yahweh said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.U≤The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire.U‡When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. The people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.UùWhen Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.UæThe others came out of the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.U>They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.T  It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.U\All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.UàFor Joshua didn't draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.UåOnly the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua.UOSo Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.U˝He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening, and at the sundown Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day.UGThen Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,T  as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron. They offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh, and sacrificed peace offerings.UrHe wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.Tì  All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who carried the ark of Yahweh's covenant, the foreigner as well as the native; half of them in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.UÄAfterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.U∂There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua didn't read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.t(NT  It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of itU]that they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.USBut when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,Uüthey also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,Usand old and patched shoes on their feet, and wore old garments. All the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.UüThey went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a far country. Now therefore make a covenant with us."UjThe men of Israel said to the Hivites, "What if you live among us. How could we make a covenant with you?"UhThey said to Joshua, "We are your servants." Joshua said to them, "Who are you? Where do you come from?"U£They said to him, "Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God; for we have heard of his fame, all that he did in Egypt,Uôand all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.UŒOur elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, 'Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and tell them, "We are your servants. Now make a covenant with us."'UïThis our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy.UöThese wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey."URThe men sampled their provisions, and didn't ask counsel from the mouth of Yahweh.U|Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them.UûIt happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they lived among them.UêThe children of Israel traveled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.UµThe children of Israel didn't strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. All the congregation murmured against the princes.UãBut all the princes said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.UmThis we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them."UòThe princes said to them, "Let them live, so they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them."UåJoshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you live among us?UíNow therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God."T*  They answered Joshua, and said, "Because your servants were certainly told how Yahweh your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.UTNow, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do."UoHe did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they didn't kill them.UüThat day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place which he should choose.t(NT  Now it happened when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;Uôthat they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.UûTherefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,Uz"Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."T  Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.UÛThe men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, "Don't abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us."UgSo Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.U}Yahweh said to Joshua, "Don't fear them, for I have delivered them into your hands. Not a man of them will stand before you."UIJoshua therefore came on them suddenly. He went up from Gilgal all night.UªYahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah.T  It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than who the children of Israel killed with the sword.U◊Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, "Sun, stand still on Gibeon! You, moon, stop in the valley of Aijalon!"U‰The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn't this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of the sky, and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day.U{There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel.U@Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.UBThese five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.UTJoshua was told, saying, "The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."UZJoshua said, "Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;U°but don't stay. Pursue your enemies, and them from the rear. Don't allow them to enter into their cities; for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand."U—It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,UÖthat all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.UaThen Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me."U≠They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.T  It happened, when they brought those kings out to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, "Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings." They came near, and put their feet on their necks.UõJoshua said to them, "Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and of good courage, for Yahweh will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight."UÅAfterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees until the evening.T  It happened at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.UÙJoshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining. He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.U[Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.U‰Yahweh delivered it also, with its king, into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining in it.

He left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.UbJoshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.UmJoshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.U@Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.t(NUàIt happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,Uñand to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,Uªto the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.UõThey went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.UoAll these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.U»Yahweh said to Joshua, "Don't be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver them up all slain before Israel.

There was no one left who breathed. He burnt Hazor with fire.UµJoshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.UtBut as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only.

They didn't leave any who breathed.UãAs Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.U¨So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;U¢from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.U1Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.UâThere was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle.UÃFor it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.UÌJoshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.UÄThere were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel.

Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.UñI was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. I brought him word again as it was in my heart.UuNevertheless, my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.U∞Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land where you walked shall be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have wholly followed Yahweh my God.'U÷Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. Now, behold, I am eighty-five years old, today.UöAs yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, to go out and to come in.UıNow therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and great and fortified cities. It may be that Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke."UXJoshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.UñTherefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because he wholly followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.UtNow the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man among the Anakim.

Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers."T0  The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned, according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.UŸWhen they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look at.T  The children of Israel heard this, "Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains to the children of Israel."UüWhen the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.U∂The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,U∂and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel.UúThey came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,UÍ"Thus says the whole congregation of Yahweh, 'What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in that you have built you an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh?UùIs the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,Uµthat you must turn away this day from following Yahweh? It will be, seeing that you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.T!  However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh, in which Yahweh's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us; but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in building an altar other than the altar of Yahweh our God.UßDidn't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? That man didn't perish alone in his iniquity.'"UèThen the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,UÆ"The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows; and Israel shall know: if it was in rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh (don't save us this day),Uøthat we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to offer burnt offering or meal offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings, let Yahweh himself require it.UªIf we have not out of concern done this, and for a reason, saying, 'In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, "What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?UÃFor Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad. You have no portion in Yahweh."' So your children might make our children cease from fearing Yahweh.UmTherefore we said, 'Let's now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;T4  but it will be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may perform the service of Yahweh before him with our burnt offerings, with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings;' that your children may not tell our children in time to come, 'You have no portion in Yahweh.'T  Therefore we said, 'It shall be, when they tell us or our generations this in time to come, that we shall say, "Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you."'UÛFar be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle!"U˙When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.T8  Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, "Today we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us, because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh. Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh."UÊPhinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.U◊The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived.UiThe children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar "A Witness Between Us that Yahweh is God."t(NUèIt happened after many days, when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from their enemies all around, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years,U≠that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said to them, "I am old and well advanced in years.UÜYou have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations because of you; for it is Yahweh your God who has fought for you.U“Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea toward the going down of the sun.UõYahweh your God will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight.

Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.UyI sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in its midst: and afterward I brought you out.UñI brought your fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea.UŒWhen they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and you lived in the wilderness many days.UƒI brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand. You possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.UÑThen Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;Uebut I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered you out of his hand.U‡You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.UèI sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow.U¶I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities which you didn't build, and you live in them. You eat of vineyards and olive groves which you didn't plant.'UùNow therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth. Put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, in Egypt; and serve Yahweh.U˝If it seems evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh."U[The people answered, "Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;T  for it is Yahweh our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed.UíYahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve Yahweh; for he is our God."UìJoshua said to the people, "You can't serve Yahweh; for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God.

So Simeon went with him.UâJudah went up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they struck of them in Bezek ten thousand men.UpThey found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.UlBut Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.U‘Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.UÄThe children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.UéAfterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.UòJudah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and they struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.UgFrom there he went against the inhabitants of Debir.

Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.UÉBarak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.U∆Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.UJThey told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.U©Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.UÀDeborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand; hasn't Yahweh gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.U©Yahweh confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.U´But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.U≠However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.U°Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don't be afraid.

In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.T  Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn't come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.UõIsrael sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land to my place.UóBut Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.UøYahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.U}They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.U{So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?UîWon't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.UçNow are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?U While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn't you recover them within that time?UÆI therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: Yahweh, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.UcHowever the king of the children of Ammon didn't listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.U∏Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.UhJephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,U»then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.UpSo Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.UøHe struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.UæJephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.U÷It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can't go back.UﬁShe said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.U≠She said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.UÉHe said, Go. He sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her virginity on the mountains.U±It happened at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she was a virgin. It was a custom in Israel,Uqthat the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.t(NUÊThe men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah, Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didn't call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.UîJephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn't save me out of their hand.U“When I saw that you didn't save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand: why then are you come up to me this day, to fight against me?UÔThen Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, [and] in the midst of Manasseh.U◊The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites.

Please take her, instead.UlSamson said to them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.UìSamson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.UÆWhen he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.UﬂThen the Philistines said, Who has done this? They said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion. The Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.UoSamson said to them, If you do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.UqHe struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.USThen the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.UÉThe men of Judah said, Why are you come up against us?

They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.U—When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to him, Who brought you here? and what do you in this place? and what have you here?UhHe said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I am become his priest.UuThey said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.UOThe priest said to them, Go in peace: before Yahweh is your way wherein you go.TN  Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were therein, how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put [them] to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.UbThey came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, What [say] you?U∏They said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good: and are you still? don't be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.U¨When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.UÉThere set forth from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.UóThey went up, and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah: therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan, to this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.UQThey passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.U˘Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.UÖThey turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.UwThe six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.U˝The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.UúWhen these went into Micah's house, and fetched the engraved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, What do you?U·They said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?UÇThe priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people.UaSo they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them.U°When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.UÄThey cried to the children of Dan. They turned their faces, and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with such a company?UñHe said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say you to me, What ails you?U§The children of Dan said to him, "Don't let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household."UThe children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.U¿They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.U∑There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city, and lived therein.UñThey called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however the name of the city was Laish at the first.U÷The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.UkSo they set them up Micah's engraved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.t(NUœIt happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah.UôHis concubine played the prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Bethlehem Judah, and was there the space of four months.U˝Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of donkeys: and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.UÑHis father-in-law, the young lady's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they ate and drink, and lodged there.UÂIt happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the young lady's father said to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.UßSo they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together: and the young lady's father said to the man, Please be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.UVThe man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.UµHe arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady's father said, Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines; and they ate, both of them.TJ  When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady's father, said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that you may go home.UÕBut the man wouldn't stay that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled; his concubine also was with him.UßWhen they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.UëHis master said to him, We won't turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.UsHe said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.UnSo they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.U≠They turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge.UªBehold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.UÑHe lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Where go you?

But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.U±All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar: and the ambushers of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.UîThere came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they didn't know that evil was close on them.UüYahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.U©So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.UâThe ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.UåNow the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.U∆The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.U¨But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky.UiThe men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil had come on them.U√Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst.UçThey surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, [and] trod them down at [their] resting place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrise.ULThere fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were] men of valor.U…They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them two thousand men.UzSo that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these [were] men of valor.U}But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.U‰The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.t(NUsNow the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife.UmThe people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.U~They said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?UÇIt happened on the next day that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.UıThe children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn't come up in the assembly to Yahweh?

He said, I will redeem it.U∑Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.UéThe near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: take my right of redemption on you; for I can't redeem it.U„Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.ULSo the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. He drew off his shoe.U∑Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.T  Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.U˝All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:UÖand let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman.UvSo Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.UáThe women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.U•He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.UGNaomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.UñThe women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.UWNow this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,ULand Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,UTand Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,UIand Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,UJand Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.ttq	(U1 Samuel(NU¡Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:Uåand he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.U∂This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.UyWhen the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:U]but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.USHer rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.U[as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.UíElkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why don't you eat? and why is your heart grieved? am I not better to you than ten sons?UüSo Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh.UCShe was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept sore.T!  She vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.UOIt happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli marked her mouth.UÅNow Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.UKEli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.UïHannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.UÅDon't count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.UeThen Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.UàShe said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn't sad any more.U¨They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.UôIt happened, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of Yahweh.UaThe man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.UπBut Hannah didn't go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not go up] until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and there abide forever.U∂Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good; wait until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word. So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.UºWhen she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh: and the child was young.U3They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.UlShe said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.URFor this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him:Uttherefore also I have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh. He worshiped Yahweh there.t(NUúHannah prayed, and said: My heart exults in Yahweh! My horn is exalted in Yahweh. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.UgThere is no one as holy as Yahweh, For there is no one besides you, nor is there any rock like our God.UåTalk no more so exceeding proudly. Don't let arrogance come out of your mouth, For Yahweh is a God of knowledge. By him actions are weighed.USThe bows of the mighty men are broken. Those who stumbled are girded with strength.UÆThose who were full have hired themselves out for bread. Those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]. Yes, the barren has borne seven. She who has many children languishes.UFYahweh kills, and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.UCYahweh makes poor, and makes rich. He brings low, he also lifts up.UÿHe raises up the poor out of the dust. He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory, for the pillars of the earth are Yahweh's. He has set the world on them.UÅHe will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for no man shall prevail by strength.U–Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in the sky. Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.U[Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child did minister to Yahweh before Eli the priest.U;Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn't know Yahweh.U≤The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;U±and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.UµYes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.U≈If the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say, No, but you shall give it to me now: and if not, I will take it by force.UcThe sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.UNBut Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.UïMoreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.UóEli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh. They went to their own home.UuYahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.UõNow Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.U_He said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.UWNo, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make Yahweh's people to disobey.U⁄If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they didn't listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh was minded to kill them.UUThe child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.U¨There came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh's house?UÌand did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?U»Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?T  Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever: but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.UäBehold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.UöYou shall see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth which [God] shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.UøThe man of yours, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar, [shall be] to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.UÄThis shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.UªI will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.U„It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Please put me into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.t(NU~The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. The word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.U}It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),UÄand the lamp of God hadn't yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down [to sleep], in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God was;U2that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.UtHe ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. He said, I didn't call; lie down again. He went and lay down.UöYahweh called yet again, Samuel. Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. He answered, I didn't call, my son; lie down again.UVNow Samuel didn't yet know Yahweh, neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to him.UúYahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.U±Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.UvYahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for your servant hears.UyYahweh said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.UwIn that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.UßFor I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse on themselves, and he didn't restrain them.UáTherefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.UpSamuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.UEThen Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. He said, Here am I.U¡He said, "What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you? Please don't hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you."UlSamuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. He said, It is Yahweh: let him do what seems him good.UWSamuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.UaAll Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.UgYahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.t(NU¢The word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.U¿The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.T  When the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.U„So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits [above] the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.UWhen the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.U¡When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? They understood that the ark of Yahweh was come into the camp.UåThe Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. They said, Woe to us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore.U†Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.U•Be strong, and behave yourselves like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.U´The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.USThe ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.UÄThere ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head.U∏When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.U}When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means the noise of this tumult? The man hurried, and came and told Eli.UTNow Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.U~The man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. He said, How went the matter, my son?UÿHe who brought the news answered, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.U›It happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli] fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.U˚His daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came on her.U®About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Don't be afraid; for you have brought forth a son. But she didn't answer, neither did she regard it.UõShe named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.UIShe said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.t(NUZNow the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.UaThe Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.UÆWhen they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh.

Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.UÿWhen the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.UéThe children of Israel said to Samuel, "Don't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."UêSamuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh: and Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel; and Yahweh answered him.UÁAs Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.UsThe men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.UÇThen Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto has Yahweh helped us.UûSo the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel: and the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.UﬂThe cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and its border did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines.

Now therefore get you up; for at this time you shall find him.U~They went up to the city; [and] as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.UANow Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,T	  Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.UÄWhen Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! this same shall have authority over my people.U`Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, Please, where the seer's house is.U≈Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.U√As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don't set your mind on them; for they are found. For whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father's house?UøSaul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you to me after this manner?U®Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.UcSamuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you.T  The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. [Samuel] said, Behold, that which has been reserved! set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.U`When they were come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.U”They arose early: and it happened about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send you away. Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.U√As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand you still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.t(NUüThen Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Isn't it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?T6  When you are departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel's tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, The donkeys which you went to seek are found; and behold, your father has left off caring for the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?T   Then you shall go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet you there three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:Uaand they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.T>  After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you are come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:U{and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.UjLet it be, when these signs are come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.UÂYou shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: you shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.UÅIt was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day.UèWhen they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.U–It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?UtOne of the same place answered, Who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?UBWhen he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.UóSaul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went you? He said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.U<Saul's uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samuel said to you.UúSaul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn't tell him.U6Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;Uﬂand he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:U¸but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, [No], but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your thousands.UUSo Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.U∑He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.UáTherefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a man to come here? Yahweh answered, Behold, he has hid himself among the baggage.UáThey ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.UÆSamuel said to all the people, "You see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?" All the people shouted, and said, [Long] live the king.U•Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.UfSaul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the army, whose hearts God had touched.UÖBut certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? They despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.t(NUüThen Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.U°Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel.U∏The elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to you.UêThen came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.UòBehold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep? They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.UeThe Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.T$  He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn't come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.UxHe numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.UŸThey said to the messengers who came, Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance. The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.UxTherefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.T  It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it happened, that those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.UvThe people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.UmSaul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.U[Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.U‘All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.t(NU{Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.UüNow, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth to this day.T	  Here I am: witness against me before Yahweh, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose donkey have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.UjThey said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any man's hand.UúHe said to them, Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand. They said, He is witness.UÅSamuel said to the people, It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.UòNow therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh, which he did to you and to your fathers.U∂When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.U‘But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.U«They cried to Yahweh, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.UïYahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.U§When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No, but a king shall reign over us; when Yahweh your God was your king.UyNow therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.UŒIf you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, and both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God, [well]:U¨but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh be against you, as it was against your fathers.UZNow therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your eyes.U”Isn't it wheat harvest today? I will call to Yahweh, that he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of Yahweh, in asking you a king.U{So Samuel called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.UõAll the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins [this] evil, to ask us a king.U¢Samuel said to the people, "Don't be afraid; you have indeed done all this evil; yet don't turn aside from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart:Urand don't turn aside; for [then would you go] after vain things which can't profit nor deliver, for they are vain.UÄFor Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name's sake, because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself.UôMoreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.UpOnly fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he has done for you.USBut if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king."t(NUaSaul was [forty] years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,UÓSaul chose him three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.UØJonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.UƒAll Israel heard say that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.U˘The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.U¡When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.U°Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.UñHe stayed seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed]: but Samuel didn't come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.UgSaul said, Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings. He offered the burnt offering.UüIt came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.UŸSamuel said, What have you done? Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn't come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;U≠therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven't entreated the favor of Yahweh: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.U¡Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you: for now would Yahweh have established your kingdom on Israel forever.UœBut now your kingdom shall not continue: Yahweh has sought him a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.UäSamuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.UãSaul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.UíThe spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;U°and another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.UÜNow there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:Urbut all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle;Uxyet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.U–So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.UAThe garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.t(NUÀNow it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side. But he didn't tell his father.UñSaul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;U∑and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people didn't know that Jonathan was gone.UÂBetween the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.UdThe one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.U⁄Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint to Yahweh to save by many or by few.UtHis armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart: turn you, behold, I am with you according to your heart.UaThen said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will disclose ourselves to them.UuIf they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.UáBut if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign to us.UÆBoth of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.U‚The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me; for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.UúJonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.UíThat first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.UøThere was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.UyThe watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went [here] and there.U¶Then said Saul to the people who were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. When they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.UxSaul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was [there] at that time with the children of Israel.U≠It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.U∑Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, [and there was] a very great confusion.U”Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, [from the country] all around, even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.U∑Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.UISo Yahweh saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.U–The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eats any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food.UGAll the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.UâWhen the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.UÈBut Jonathan didn't hear when his father commanded the people with the oath: therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.U´Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man who eats food this day. The people were faint.UåThen said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.U™How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.U]They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;Uêand the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.UÆThen they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Yahweh, in that they eat with the blood. He said, you have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone to me this day.T   Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don't sin against Yahweh in eating with the blood. All the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.UTSaul built an altar to Yahweh: the same was the first altar that he built to Yahweh.UÓSaul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. They said, Do whatever seems good to you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.UìSaul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he didn't answer him that day.UnSaul said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been this day.UúFor, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.UòThen said he to all Israel, Be you on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. The people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you.UÄTherefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, Show the right. Jonathan and Saul were taken [by lot]; but the people escaped.UJSaul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son. Jonathan was taken.UæThen Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.UGSaul said, God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.T  The people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn't die.U^Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.T  Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he put [them] to the worse.UoHe did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.U≤Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:Uåand the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.UNKish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.UäThere was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.t(NUòSamuel said to Saul, Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of Yahweh.UìThus says Yahweh of Armies, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.U©Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don't spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.UsSaul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.U=Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.UıSaul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.UQSaul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.UoHe took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.UˆBut Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn't utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.U/Then came the word of Yahweh to Samuel, saying,UµIt grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.UΩSamuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.UqSamuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed are you by Yahweh: I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.UnSamuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I hear?UæSaul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.UrThen Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me this night. He said to him, Say on.UêSamuel said, "Though you were little in your own sight, weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;Uëand Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, 'Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.'UyWhy then didn't you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?"UΩSaul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.UBut the people took of the spoil, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.UºSamuel said, Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.U∞For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.UõSaul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.UWNow therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.UìSamuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.UZAs Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold on the skirt of his robe, and it tore.UåSamuel said to him, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.U`Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.U•Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, Please, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.U=So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.UóThen said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.UïSamuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women. Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.UKThen Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.UìSamuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.t(NUÍYahweh said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go: I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.UåSamuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. Yahweh said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh.UvCall Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.UãSamuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Come you peaceably?U±He said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.UkIt happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab, and said, Surely Yahweh's anointed is before him.U›But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Don't look on his face, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for [Yahweh sees] not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart."UeThen Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.ULThen Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.UfJesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, Yahweh has not chosen these.U‘Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? He said, There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is keeping the sheep. Samuel said to Jesse, Send and get him; for we will not sit down until he come here.UïHe sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on. Yahweh said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.UΩThen Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.UYNow the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.UKSaul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.UÈLet our lord now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp: and it shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.UWSaul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.UÔThen answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.UaTherefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.UoJesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.UcDavid came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.UaSaul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.UπIt happened, when the [evil] spirit from God was on Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.t(NU∂Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.UãSaul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.UèThe Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.U}There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.UâHe had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.URHe had brass shin armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.UìThe staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield bearer went before him.U”He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose a man for you, and let him come down to me.U§If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then you will be our servants, and serve us.UeThe Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.UeWhen Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.U∏Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken [in years] among men.U√The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.U;David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.UPNow David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.UOThe Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.U§Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry [them] quickly to the camp to your brothers;Uuand bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.UiNow Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.U‰David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.UFIsrael and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.UxDavid left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.U∆As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.URAll the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.T  The men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.UÓDavid spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?U`The people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man who kills him.T4  Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why are you come down? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle.U7David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?UÉHe turned away from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.UbWhen the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.UpDavid said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.UíSaul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.UâDavid said to Saul, Your servant was keeping his father's sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,U°I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.UùYour servant struck both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.UÃDavid said, Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. Saul said to David, Go, and Yahweh shall be with you.UqSaul clad David with his clothing, and he put a helmet of brass on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.U¥David girded his sword on his clothing, and he tried to go; for he had not proved it. David said to Saul, I can't go with these; for I have not proved them. David put them off him.UŸHe took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.U_The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.UÄWhen the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face.UsThe Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks? The Philistine cursed David by his gods.U~The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.UœThen said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.T(  This day will Yahweh deliver you into my hand; and I will strike you, and take your head from off you; and I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,Uíand that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn't save with sword and spear: for the battle is Yahweh's, and he will give you into our hand.UëIt happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.UªDavid put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.UùSo David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.U”Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him, and cut off his head therewith. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.UﬁThe men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.UbThe children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.UeDavid took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.UµWhen Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth? Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I can't tell.U4The king said, "Inquire whose son the young man is!"UêAs David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.UxSaul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man? David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.t(NUúIt happened, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.UPSaul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.UNThen Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.UíJonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his clothing, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his sash.UƒDavid went out wherever Saul sent him, [and] behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.UÎIt happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.UnThe women sang one to another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands.U√Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?U*Saul eyed David from that day and forward.U”It happened on the next day, that an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;Utand Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will strike David even to the wall. David avoided out of his presence twice.URSaul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him, and was departed from Saul.U}Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.UFDavid behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh was with him.UJWhen Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.UNBut all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.U‡Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you as wife: only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh's battles. For Saul said, Don't let my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.U~David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, [or] my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?UèBut it happened at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.UTMichal, Saul's daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.UÃSaul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son-in-law a second time.U∏Saul commanded his servants, [saying], Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king's son-in-law.U±Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?UBThe servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.UŸSaul said, Thus you shall tell David, The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.UwWhen his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. The days were not expired;U˝and David arose and went, he and his men, and killed of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.UUSaul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.UNSaul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually.U≈Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it happened, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.t(NUàSaul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.U©Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you: now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself:Uöand I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will commune with my father of you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.UŸJonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Don't let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you:U◊for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel: you saw it, and did rejoice; why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?UfSaul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put to death.UáJonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before.UãThere was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.UAn evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.U∑Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he struck the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.U¡Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning: and Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If you don't save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be slain.UPSo Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.UÅMichal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' [hair] at its head, and covered it with the clothes.U>When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.UbSaul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.UoWhen the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' [hair] at its head.U¶Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is escaped? Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?UçNow David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.U>It was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.U—Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.UèWhen it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.U©Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? One said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.UãHe went there to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.U≤He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"t(NU¨David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my iniquity?" and "What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"U«He said to him, "Far from it; you shall not die: behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so."U¸David swore moreover, and said, "Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says, 'Don't let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:' but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death."UUThen said Jonathan to David, "Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you."U∑David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.UÆIf your father miss me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'UvIf he says, 'It is well;' your servant shall have peace: but if he be angry, then know that evil is determined by him.UÕTherefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you: but if there be in me iniquity, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?"UñJonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn't I tell you that?"U]Then said David to Jonathan, "Who shall tell me if perchance your father answer you roughly?"UdJonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out into the field." They both went out into the field.UÍJonathan said to David, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, [be witness]: when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, [or] the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?U÷Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I don't disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and Yahweh be with you, as he has been with my father.UZYou shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of Yahweh, that I not die;U°but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth."UuSo Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying], Yahweh will require it at the hand of David's enemies.UqJonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.UmThen Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.U∞When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.UBI will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.U«Behold, I will send the boy, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I tell the boy, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you; take them, and come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as Yahweh lives.UkBut if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.UdAs touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and me forever.UeSo David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.UúThe king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side: but David's place was empty.UáNevertheless Saul didn't say anything that day: for he thought, Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.U◊It happened on the next day after the new moon, [which was] the second [day], that David's place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why doesn't the son of Jesse come to meat, neither yesterday, nor today?UMJonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:T
  and he said, Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me [to be there]: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers. Therefore he is not come to the king's table.UﬁThen Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don't I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?U§For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.UfJonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"UuSaul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.U£So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.U~It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.UhHe said to his boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.UåWhen the boy was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, Isn't the arrow beyond you?UyJonathan cried after the boy, Go fast! Hurry! Don't delay! Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.UJBut the boy didn't know anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.URJonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.U‹As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.UÏJonathan said to David, Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of Yahweh, saying, Yahweh shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever. He arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.t(NUîThen came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?U˙David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.UmNow therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.UúThe priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.U˛David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then today shall their vessels be holy?U¨So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.UßNow a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.U±David said to Ahimelech, Isn't there here under your hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.T  The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here. David said, There is none like that; give it to me.UUDavid arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.U¬The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David the king of the land? Didn't they sing one to another about him in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?'"UWDavid laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.U†He changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.UdThen said Achish to his servants, Look, you see the man is mad; why then have you brought him to me?U|Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?t(NUõDavid therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.UÀEveryone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.U¨David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Please let my father and my mother come forth, [and be] with you, until I know what God will do for me.UpHe brought them before the king of Moab: and they lived with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.U°The prophet Gad said to David, Don't stay in the stronghold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.U–Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.UŒSaul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,T  that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none who discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?UíThen answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.UcHe inquired of Yahweh for him, and gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.U£Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.UHSaul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub.

But the servants of the king wouldn't put forth their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh.U¥The king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests. Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore a linen ephod.U≤Nob, the city of the priests, struck he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies, and cattle and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.U_One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.U9Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh's priests.UµDavid said to Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned [the death] of all the persons of your father's house.UtAbide you with me, don't be afraid; for he who seeks my life seeks your life: for with me you shall be in safeguard.t(NUsThey told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.UõTherefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? Yahweh said to David, Go, and strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.UäDavid's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?UîThen David inquired of Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.U∂David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.UuIt happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.U¢It was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.UXSaul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.UqDavid knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.UèThen said David, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.UºWill the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant. Yahweh said, He will come down.UÅThen said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me and my men into the hand of Saul? Yahweh said, They will deliver you up.U«Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. It was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there.U≤David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God didn't deliver him into his hand.UgDavid saw that Saul had come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.U_Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.U∂He said to him, Don't be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.UdThey two made a covenant before Yahweh: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.UµThen came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?UñNow therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king's hand.UGSaul said, Blessed be you of Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me.UóPlease go make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, [and] who has seen him there; for it is told me that he deals very subtly.U¸See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come you again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall happen, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.UâThey arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.U¡Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.UŒSaul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.UrBut there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.UÅSo Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.UBDavid went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.t(NUêIt happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.U~Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.U©He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.UÛThe men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.UZIt happened afterward, that David's heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.UûHe said to his men, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh's anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Yahweh's anointed.UâSo David checked his men with these words, and didn't allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.UΩDavid also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.UYDavid said to Saul, Why listen you to men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks your hurt?UÒBehold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you; but [my eye] spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh's anointed.T!  Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn't kill you, know you and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt after my life to take it.U^Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.UoAs says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be on you.UdAfter whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.U~Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.U¢It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.UwHe said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to you evil.UåYou have declared this day how that you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn't kill me.UëFor if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day.UtNow, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.UêSwear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.UYDavid swore to Saul. Saul went home; but David and his men got them up to the stronghold.t(NU®Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.U∂There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.UŸNow the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful face: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.U@David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.UvDavid sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:UÜand thus you shell tell him who lives [in prosperity], Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.U∂Now I have heard that you have shearers: your shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there anything missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.UÕAsk your young men, and they will tell you: therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.UoWhen David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.UõNabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants who break away from their masters these days.UìShall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don't know where they come from?UlSo David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.U€David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword. They girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.UúBut one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to Greet our master; and he railed at them.UçBut the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:Ucthey were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.U∂Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow that one can't speak to him.UÓThen Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.UmShe said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she didn't tell her husband, Nabal.UôIt was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.UπNow David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him: and he has returned me evil for good.UìGod do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.UÜWhen Abigail saw David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.UòShe fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me be the iniquity; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears. Hear the words of your handmaid.U÷Please don't let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your handmaid didn't see the young men of my lord, whom you did send.UˆNow therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, seeing Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.UpNow this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.U¬Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid: for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh; and evil shall not be found in you all your days.UÊThough men be risen up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.U´It shall come to pass, when Yahweh shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you prince over Israel,UÂthat this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When Yahweh shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.U^David said to Abigail, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me:Uêand blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.UÚFor in very deed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from hurting you, except you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn't have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.UµSo David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, Go up in peace to your house; behold, I have listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.U‚Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.UûIt happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.ULIt happened about ten days after, that Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died.T0  When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil: and the evildoing of Nabal has Yahweh returned on his own head. David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him as wife.UãWhen the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.UíShe arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.UùAbigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.UKDavid also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.UcNow Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.t(NU|The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?UóThen Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.U™Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.UQDavid therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.UÏDavid arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him.U«Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? Abishai said, I will go down with you.U…So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay around him.U—Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.UuDavid said to Abishai, Don't destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against Yahweh's anointed, and be guiltless?U~David said, As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.U†Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against Yahweh's anointed: but now please take the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.U‹So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head; and they got them away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them.UxThen David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;Uîand David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Don't you answer, Abner? Then Abner answered, Who are you who cries to the king?UÕDavid said to Abner, Aren't you a [valiant] man? and who is like you in Israel? why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king your lord.U‚This thing isn't good that you have done. As Yahweh lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, Yahweh's anointed. Now see where the king's spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head.UqSaul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice, my son David? David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.UeHe said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?TL  Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Yahweh that has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Yahweh: for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn't cling to Yahweh's inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.UºNow therefore, don't let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.UƒThen said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.U]David answered, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and get it.U¥Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn't put forth my hand against Yahweh's anointed.UúBehold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Yahweh, and let him deliver me out of all oppression.U£Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David: you shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.t(NT  David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.UuDavid arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.U≤David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.URIt was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.U—David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?U\Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day.UjThe number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.UÿDavid and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those [nations] were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.UæDavid struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the cattle, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned, and came to Achish.UØAchish said, Against whom have you made a raid today? David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.U”David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so has been his manner all the while he has lived in the country of the Philistines.U|Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant forever.t(NUÿIt happened in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel.

Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.T3  Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.UiSamuel said, Why then do you ask of me, seeing Yahweh is departed from you, and is become your adversary?UäYahweh has done to you, as he spoke by me: and Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David.UëBecause you didn't obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn't execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has Yahweh done this thing to you this day.U—Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me: Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.U…Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.U◊The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.U´Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.UµBut he refused, and said, I will not eat.

He said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.UéWe made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.UÃDavid said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop? He said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.UÈWhen he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.U©David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.USDavid recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.U®There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.U|David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove before those [other] livestock, and said, This is David's spoil.T  David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him: and when David came near to the people, he greeted them.T  Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, and said, Because they didn't go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.U¨Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.U°Who will listen to you in this matter? for as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike.UcIt was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.U•When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh:UkTo those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,Ueand to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,Uçand to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,Udand to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan, and to those who were in Athach,Udand to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.t(NUáNow the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.UãThe Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.UxThe battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.UˇThen said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.U_When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him.U`So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.U¸When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.UäIt happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.U™They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.UfThey put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.UgWhen the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,UÆall the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.U`They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.ttq
(U2 Samuel(NUäIt happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;U“it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.U`David said to him, From whence come you? He said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.U«David said to him, How went the matter? Please tell me. He answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.U_David said to the young man who told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?U≥The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.UNWhen he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, Here am I.U>He said to me, Who are you? I answered him, I am an Amalekite.UHe said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.U‚So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.U_Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him:U∏and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.UqDavid said to the young man who told him, Whence are you? He answered, I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.U_David said to him, How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed?UfDavid called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. He struck him, so that he died.UÄDavid said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh's anointed.UHDavid lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his sonUr(and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of] the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):UMYour glory, Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!U£Don't tell it in Gath. Don't publish it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.U¡You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings; For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.U{From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, Jonathan's bow didn't turn back. Saul's sword didn't return empty.UüSaul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives. In their death, they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles. They were stronger than lions.U{You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.U\How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.UäI am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.U;How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!t(NUΩIt happened after this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? Yahweh said to him, Go up. David said, Where shall I go up? He said, To Hebron.UvSo David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.UsHis men who were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they lived in the cities of Hebron.U†The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, saying, The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.U±David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, Blessed be you of Yahweh, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.U~Now Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because you have done this thing.UîNow therefore let your hands be strong, and be you valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.UyNow Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;UÖand he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.UêIshbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.U^The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.UgAbner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.U∆Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.UaAbner said to Joab, Please let the young men arise and play before us. Joab said, Let them arise.UÜThen they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.UªThey caught everyone his fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.UoThe battle was very severe that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.UwThe three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.UoAsahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn't turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.UPThen Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it you, Asahel? He answered, It is I.UªAbner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.UúAbner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: why should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?T%  However he refused to turn aside: therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it happened, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.UßBut Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.UwThe children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.UﬁThen Abner called to Joab, and said, "Shall the sword devour forever? Don't you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you bid the people return from following their brothers?"UáJoab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed everyone his brother.UySo Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.UéAbner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.UèJoab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.UmBut the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three hundred sixty men died.UúThey took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.t(NUúNow there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.U\To David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;Uîand his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;UYand the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;USand the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.UáIt happened, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.UïNow Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and [Ishbosheth] said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?TB  Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? This day do I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman.U_God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to David, I don't do even so to him;Uâto transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.U>He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.U∫Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying [also], Make your league with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.UøHe said, Well; I will make a league with you; but one thing I require of you: that is, you shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.U§David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.USIshbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.UÄHer husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return: and he returned.UrAbner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past you sought for David to be king over you:U¬now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.U©Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.UrSo Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.UÊAbner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires. David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.UΩBehold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.UßWhen Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.UëThen Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?UáYou know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.UéWhen Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David didn't know it.UƒWhen Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.UÉAfterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:Uﬁlet it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.UqSo Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.U¢David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. King David followed the bier.UwThey buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.UGThe king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dies?UõYour hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell. All the people wept again over him.UπAll the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun be down.UgAll the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.UnSo all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.UqThe king said to his servants, "Don't you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?UùI am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May Yahweh reward the evildoer according to his wickedness."t(NUÇWhen [Ishbosheth], Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.UÔ[Ishbosheth], Saul's son, [had] two men who were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:UXand the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until this day).T  Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.UóThe sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon.U°They came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.UΩNow when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.UÎThey brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; and Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.U¢David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,UØwhen one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.U´How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?UﬂDavid commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.t(NUrThen came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.U¿In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel: and Yahweh said to you, You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.U£So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh: and they anointed David king over Israel.UNDavid was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.UÖIn Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.U„The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here; thinking, David can't come in here.UNNevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.UÒDavid said on that day, Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and [strike] the lame and the blind, who are hated of David's soul. Therefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he can't come into the house.UiDavid lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. David built around from Millo and inward.ULDavid grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with him.UwHiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.UÉDavid perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.UéDavid took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.UmThese are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,U/and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,U(and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.U¨When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.ULNow the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.U∆David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand? Yahweh said to David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.U¡David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.UCThey left their images there; and David and his men took them away.URThe Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.UäWhen David inquired of Yahweh, he said, You shall not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.U∆It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself; for then is Yahweh gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.UdDavid did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.t(NULDavid again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.U”David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies who sits [above] the cherubim.U¶They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.UwThey brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.U‘David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with castanets, and with cymbals.UãWhen they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled.U{The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.UrDavid was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah; and he called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day.UYDavid was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Yahweh come to me?UéSo David would not remove the ark of Yahweh to him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.UThe ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom, and all his house.UÈIt was told king David, saying, Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy.UsIt was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.UWDavid danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.UsSo David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.U–It was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and she despised him in her heart.U∏They brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.UâWhen David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies.UﬂHe dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a cake of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed everyone to his house.T  Then David returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!U»David said to Michal, [It was] before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel: therefore will I play before Yahweh.UáI will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my own sight: but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken, they shall honor me.UAMichal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.t(NUmIt happened, when the king lived in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around,Uzthat the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.URNathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.UKIt happened the same night, that the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying,U^Go and tell my servant David, Thus says Yahweh, Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in?U´for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.UﬂIn all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?UøNow therefore thus you shall tell my servant David, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people, over Israel;U∂and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.U–I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,Uªand [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause you to rest from all your enemies.

The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.UmDavid struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.U∞David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.U{When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.UúThen David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.UeDavid took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.UXFrom Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.UNWhen Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer,U˙then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.

Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.U^David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his people.UZJoab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;Ueand Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;Uuand Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was over] the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers.t(NUpDavid said, Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?U†There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, Are you Ziba? He said, Your servant is he.U≠The king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? Ziba said to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet.U~The king said to him, Where is he? Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.UbThen king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.U®Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. David said, Mephibosheth.

Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.UÕThen said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your shall servant do. As for Mephibosheth, [said the king], he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.UuMephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.UmSo Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king's table. He was lame in both his feet.t(NUlIt happened after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.U„David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.U˜But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn't David sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?U¢So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.U†When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, Wait at Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return.T  When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.UIWhen David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.UøThe children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.UùNow when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:UÅThe rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.UöHe said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.UÄBe of good courage, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh do that which seems him good.UoSo Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.UΩWhen the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.UZWhen the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.UüHadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.UÆIt was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.U∆The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians [the men of] seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that he died there.U»When all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.t(NUÒIt happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out [to battle], that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.UΩIt happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.UDavid send and inquired after the woman. One said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?UúDavid sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.ULThe woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.URDavid sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite. Joab sent Uriah to David.UqWhen Uriah was come to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.UûDavid said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess [of food] from the king.UsBut Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and didn't go down to his house.U°When they had told David, saying, Uriah didn't go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Haven't you come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house?T   Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.UÜDavid said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.U∏When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn't go down to his house.U`It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.UäHe wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire you from him, that he may be struck, and die.UwIt happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.UñThe men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.U@Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;U|and he commanded the messenger, saying, "When you have made an end of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,U°it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he tells you, 'Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn't you know that they would shoot from the wall?UÎwho struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn't a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"UPSo the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.UìThe messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.UêThe shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.UÂThen David said to the messenger, Thus you shall tell Joab, Don't let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you him.UcWhen the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.U®When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.t(NUÄYahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, "There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.U,The rich man had very many flocks and herds,UÚbut the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter.UﬂA traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to him."UáDavid's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die!U[He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!"U§Nathan said to David, "You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.U–I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.UÁWhy have you despised the word of Yahweh, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.UóNow therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.'U·This is what Yahweh says: 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.UZFor you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.'"UÅDavid said to Nathan, "I have sinned against Yahweh." Nathan said to David, "Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will not die.UíHowever, because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh's enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die."UlNathan departed to his house. Yahweh struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.UhDavid therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.UåThe elders of his house arose, [and stood] beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.T&  It happened on the seventh day, that the child died. The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn't listen to our voice: how will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!U±But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, Is the child dead? They said, He is dead.UÌThen David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into the house of Yahweh, and worshiped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.U∑Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.UîHe said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?UsBut now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.UèDavid comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Yahweh loved him;U\and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named him Jedidiah, for Yahweh's sake.UQNow Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.UlJoab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yes, I have taken the city of waters.UïNow therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.U_David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.U—He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and [in it were] precious stones; and it was set on David's head. He brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.T	  He brought forth the people who were therein, and put them under saws, and under iron picks, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln: and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.t(NUâIt happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.UçAmnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.UwBut Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.UôHe said to him, Why, son of the king, are you thus lean from day to day? Won't you tell me? Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.UˇJonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and feign yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, tell him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.U÷So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let her sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.U`Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.UñSo Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.UêShe took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, Have out all men from me. They went out every man from him.UµAmnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand. Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.UqWhen she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.UyShe answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don't you do this folly.U™I, where shall I carry my shame? and as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.UgHowever he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.U≤Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.UìShe said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.UxThen he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.U¥She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.U£Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.UŸAbsalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but now hold your peace, my sister: he is your brother; don't take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.UABut when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.UmAbsalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.UëIt happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.UçAbsalom came to the king, and said, See now, your servant has sheepshearers; let the king, I pray you, and his servants go with your servant.UêThe king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. He pressed him: however he would not go, but blessed him.UsThen said Absalom, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us. The king said to him, Why should he go with you?UNBut Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.U÷Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; don't be afraid; haven't I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.UéThe servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.UóIt happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.UxThen the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.T  Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered, Don't let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.UâNow therefore don't let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.UôBut Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.U[Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are come: as your servant said, so it is.U∂It happened, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.UoBut Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. [David] mourned for his son every day.U?So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.Ur[the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.t(NUONow Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.UÂJoab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, Please, and don't anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has a long time mourned for the dead:U[and go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.UyWhen the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.UcThe king said to her, What ails you? She answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.UïYour handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him.TK  Behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid, and they say, Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.UWThe king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.UêThe woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.UbThe king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.UÿThen said she, Please let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. He said, As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of your son fall to the earth.U`Then the woman said, Please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king. He said, Say on.U The woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one.U∆For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which can't be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him.UÚNow therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.UëFor the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.UπThen your handmaid said, Please let the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Yahweh your God be with you.UäThen the king answered the woman, Please don't hide anything from me that I shall ask you. The woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.T.  The king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? The woman answered, As your soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid;U≤to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.UjThe king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.UÊJoab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.UCSo Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.UéThe king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and didn't see the king's face.U¶Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.U‘When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight.UsTo Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful face.UMAbsalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn't see the king's face.UäThen Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.UüTherefore he said to his servants, Behold, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. Absalom's servants set the field on fire.UpThen Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?T  Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.U∫So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.t(NUhIt happened after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.T	  Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? He said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.UtAbsalom said to him, Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized of the king to hear you.UîAbsalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!UxIt was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.U}In this manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.UèIt happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king, please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.UîFor your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.UCThe king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.U†But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.UÇWith Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn't know anything.U–Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.U[There came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.T  David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.UsThe king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall choose.UvThe king went forth, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.URThe king went forth, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak.U∂All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.U™Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with us? return, and abide with the king: for you are a foreigner, and also an exile; [return] to your own place.U±Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us, seeing I go where I may? return you, and take back your brothers; mercy and truth be with you.U«Ittai answered the king, and said, As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will your servant be.UÅDavid said to Ittai, Go and pass over. Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him.UΩAll the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.UœBehold, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.UÆThe king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:Ugbut if he say thus, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good to him.U™The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.U\Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me."U]Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.UÈDavid went up by the ascent of the [Mount of] Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.UñOne told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. David said, Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.U∞It happened that when David had come to the top [of the ascent], where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head.UKDavid said to him, If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me:UŸbut if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.U≈Don't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.U¶Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.UOSo Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.t(NT  When David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.UÏThe king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.U≤The king said, Where is your master's son? Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said, Today will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.UúThen said the king to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours. Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.U≠When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as he came.UëHe cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.UUThus said Shimei when he cursed, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow:U˘Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and behold, you are [taken] in your own mischief, because you are a man of blood.UëThen said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head."U≠The king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, Curse David; who then shall say, Why have you done so?U€David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.UIt may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day.UúSo David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.U[The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.U[Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.UìIt happened, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king.UaAbsalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?UéHushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.UîAgain, whom should I serve? Shouldn't I serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence.UDThen said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.UÿAhithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines, that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred of your father: then will the hands of all who are with you be strong.UÅSo they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.U≠The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.t(NUÉMoreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:U¢and I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid; and all the people who are with him shall flee; and I will strike the king only;UÄand I will bring back all the people to you: the man whom you seek is as if all returned: [so] all the people shall be in peace.U>The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.U[Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.UôWhen Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do [after] his saying? if not, speak up.UTHushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.UÂHushai said moreover, You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, as a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.U’Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place: and it will happen, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.U¥Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.U≤But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.U»So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.U™Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there not be one small stone found there.UÏAbsalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.UïThen Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.U Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Don't lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.U∂Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.U∞But a boy saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.UwThe woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.UÎAbsalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? The woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.UŸIt happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, Arise you, and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.U¨Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.UﬁWhen Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got him home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.UcThen David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.U≈Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.U2Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.UøIt happened, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,Uëbrought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse],U√and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.t(NUnDavid numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.T  David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.U˛But the people said, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.UèThe king said to them, What seems you best I will do. The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.U«The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.UbSo the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.UãThe people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.UäFor the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.T  Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.UWA certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.U®Joab said to the man who told him, Behold, you saw it, and why didn't you strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten [pieces of] silver, and a sash.T	  The man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand [pieces of] silver in my hand, I still wouldn't put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.UïOtherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against [me].U¨Then said Joab, I may not wait thus with you. He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.URTen young men who bore Joab's armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.UiJoab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.UúThey took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled everyone to his tent.U˝Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom's monument, to this day.U{Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.U©Joab said to him, You shall not be the bearer of news this day, but you shall bear news another day; but this day you shall bear no news, because the king's son is dead.UpThen said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen. The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.U…Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, Please let me also run after the Cushite. Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?UÄBut come what may, [said he], I will run. He said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.U∞Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.UThe watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, If he be alone, there is news in his mouth. He came apace, and drew near.UüThe watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold, [another] man running alone. The king said, He also brings news.U¢The watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. The king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news.UÂAhimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.U¥The king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don't know what it was.ULThe king said, Turn aside, and stand here. He turned aside, and stood still.UîBehold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, News for my lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you.UƒThe king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? The Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is.U≈The king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!t(NU@It was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.UÅThe victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieves for his son.UuThe people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.UiThe king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, my son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!U¸Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;U˛in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are nothing to you: for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.T  Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don't go forth, there will not stay a man with you this night: and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.UÀThen the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.UÂAll the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.UyAbsalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don't you speak a word of bringing the king back?UÔKing David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, [to bring him] to his house.UdYou are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the king?UüSay you to Amasa, Aren't you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren't captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.UóHe bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of] one man; so that they sent to the king, [saying], Return you, and all your servants.U~So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.UzShimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.UœThere were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.U©A ferry boat went to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.U‹He said to the king, Don't let my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.UûFor your servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.UxBut Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?UŸDavid said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for don't I know that I am this day king over Israel?UBThe king said to Shimei, You shall not die. The king swore to him.U–Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.UÄIt happened, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?U¥He answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.UÜHe has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes.UÃFor all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?UbThe king said to him, Why speak you any more of your matters? I say, You and Ziba divide the land.UqMephibosheth said to the king, yes, let him take all, because my lord the king is come in peace to his own house.UzBarzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.UùNow Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.U_The king said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.UzBarzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?U¯I am this day eighty years old: can I discern between good and bad? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?UzYour servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?U‰Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.UßThe king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you: and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.UéAll the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.UóSo the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.U’Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?U All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is a close relative to us: why then are you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or has he given us any gift?T6  The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right] in David than you: why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.t(NUThere happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, Israel.U¨So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.T  David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but didn't go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.UfThen said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present.UuSo Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.U…David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take your lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.U≠There went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.UıWhen they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.UrJoab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother? Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.U˘But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he struck him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn't strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.UwThere stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.U˜Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.UsWhen he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.UîHe went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.U They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.UwThen cried a wise woman out of the city, "Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, 'Come near here, that I may speak with you.'"UòHe came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab? He answered, I am. Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid. He answered, I do hear.UçThen she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel: and so they ended [the matter].UùI am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?UQJoab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.T  The matter is not so: but a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. The woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.U˚Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.U{Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;Uhand Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;U:and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;U5and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.t(NU…There was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh. Yahweh said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.T
  The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);Uéand David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?UÕThe Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. He said, What you shall say, that will I do for you.UôThey said to the king, The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, [that] we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,Uölet seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh. The king said, I will give them.U¢But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.UﬁBut the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:UÒHe delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and they fell [all] seven together. They were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.T  Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured on them from the sky; and she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night.UTIt was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.UˆDavid went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;Uáand he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.U—They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After that God was entreated for the land.UêThe Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. David grew faint;Uºand Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight, he being girded with a new [sword], thought to have slain David.U◊But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you don't quench the lamp of Israel.UùIt came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.UΩThere was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite's brother, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.U¡There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.UOWhen he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, killed him.UoThese four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.t(NUíDavid spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:UIand he said, Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;UïGod, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge.

David the son of Jesse says, the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel:U<The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me. His word was on my tongue.UyThe God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, one who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God,UÆ[He shall be] as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, [When] the tender grass [springs] out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.U–Most certainly my house is not so with God, yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure, for it is all my salvation, and all [my] desire, although he doesn't make it grow.UgBut all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away, because they can't be taken with the hand,UáBut the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear. They shall be utterly burned with fire in [their] place.U∂These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.UÿAfter him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.U¡He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil.U¬After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.UvBut he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.UÆThree of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.U\David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.UpDavid longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!U„The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.UÃHe said, Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this: [shall I drink] the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.UßAbishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.UzWasn't he most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: however he didn't attain to the [first] three.U“Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.U…He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.UXThese things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.UoHe was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain to the [first] three.

Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.UãThey passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer:Ukthen they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon,Uóand came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.U|So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.U≈Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.UÍDavid's heart struck him after that he had numbered the people. David said to Yahweh, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.UdWhen David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,UoGo and speak to David, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose one of them, that I may do it to you.T3  So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise you, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.UíDavid said to Gad, I am in distress. Let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.U†So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.T   When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay your hand. The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.UËDavid spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done?

David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.U∆Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:Udall this, king, does Araunah give to the king. Araunah said to the king, Yahweh your God accept you.UÏThe king said to Araunah, No; but I will most certainly buy it of you at a price. Neither will I offer burnt offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.

The king said to her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.UOShe said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.U€King Solomon answered his mother, Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.UÖThen king Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.U¿Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.UVKing Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died.T%  To Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bear the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.UõSo Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.U´The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he didn't turn after Absalom. Joab fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.U•It was told king Solomon, Joab is fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.UÃBenaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. He said, No; but I will die here. Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.U¨The king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.T)  Yahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David didn't know it, [to wit], Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.UƒSo shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever: but to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Yahweh.UÄThen Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.UÇThe king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.UîThe king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and don't go forth from there any where.UêFor on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know you for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head.UàShimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.U∑It happened at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath.UåShimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.UTIt was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.T	  The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Didn't I adjure you by Yahweh, and protest to you, saying, Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, you shall surely die? and you said to me, The saying that I have heard is good.UcWhy then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment that I have instructed you with?UºThe king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head.UfBut king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Yahweh forever.UôSo the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.t(NUÈSolomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem all around.UxOnly the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days.U{Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.UäThe king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.UbIn Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give you.T8  Solomon said, You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.UìNow, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I don't know how to go out or come in.UÑYour servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can't be numbered nor counted for multitude.U£Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this your great people?U?The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.UÌGod said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;Uƒbehold, I have done according to your word: behold, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there has been none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like you.UìI have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like you, all your days.UÑIf you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David did walk, then I will lengthen your days.U€Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.URThen there came two women who were prostitutes, to the king, and stood before him.U{The one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.U∞It happened the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.U<This woman's child died in the night, because she lay on it.UêShe arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.UöWhen I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore.U±The other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son. This said, No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.U°Then said the king, The one says, This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead: and the other says, No; but your son is the dead, and my son is the living.UDThe king said, Get me a sword. They brought a sword before the king.U_The king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.UThen spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it.U\Then the king answered, Give her the living child, and in no way kill it: she is its mother.UîAll Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;

they let nothing be lacking.UãBarley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where [the officers] were, every man according to his duty.UÅGod gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and very great understanding, even as the sand that is on the seashore.UbSolomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.UúFor he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations all around.UGHe spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were one thousand five.U≤He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall;

for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.USolomon sent to Hiram, saying,UºYou know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Yahweh his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Yahweh put them under the soles of his feet.UgBut now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side;

and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and you shall receive them; and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.UTSo Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.UôSolomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.UÉYahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.USKing Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.U¶He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor.UkSolomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains;Uëbesides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work.UwThe king commanded, and they cut out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone.UÜSolomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.t(NUˇIt happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Yahweh.UäThe house which king Solomon built for Yahweh, its length was sixty cubits, and its breadth twenty [cubits], and its height thirty cubits.U°The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was its length, according to the breadth of the house; [and] ten cubits was its breadth before the house.U4For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work.U±Against the wall of the house he built stories all around, against the walls of the house all around, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side chambers all around.T  The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house all around, that [the beams] should not have hold in the walls of the house.U∏The house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.U´The door for the middle side chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle [story], and out of the middle into the third.U`So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.UuHe built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.U+The word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying,U„Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.UQI will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.U,So Solomon built the house, and finished it.UÿHe built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.U≈He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls [of the ceiling]: he built [them] for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.ULThe house, that is, the temple before [the oracle], was forty cubits [long].UoThere was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.UgHe prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.U¬Within the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in its height; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.UáSo Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.UêThe whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.UGIn the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.UµFive cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.UTThe other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.UOThe height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.T	  He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.U#He overlaid the cherubim with gold.UÄHe carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside.UAThe floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.UxFor the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood: the lintel [and] door posts were a fifth part [of the wall].UÕSo [he made] two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.UlSo also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part [of the wall];Uzand two doors of fir wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.UyHe carved [thereon] cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.UVHe built the inner court with three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams.UTIn the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid, in the month Ziv.UªIn the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all its fashion. So was he seven years in building it.t(NUQSolomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.UœFor he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.UfIt was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.URThere were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.UgAll the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.UõHe made the porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.UÖHe made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.U∑His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch.U¿All these were of costly stones, even of cut stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.UiThe foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.UOAbove were costly stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood.UüThe great court around had three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Yahweh, and the porch of the house.U0King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.UÙHe was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work.UÉFor he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them about.U¨He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.UÆThere were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.U™So he made the pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.U]The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits.UØThere were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows around on the other capital.U¶He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.UQOn the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.UìHe made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.UèUnder its brim around there were buds which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea: the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.UÌIt stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.UÇIt was a handbreadth thick: and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.UÅHe made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height.UdThe work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;Uπand on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.U™Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.U◊The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth were engravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.UëThe four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.UçThe work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.U`There were four supports at the four corners of each base: its supports were of the base itself.UâIn the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same.UîOn the plates of its stays, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.U`After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.UäHe made ten basins of brass: one basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on very one of the ten bases one basin.U¨He set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.UöHiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh:U∏the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;U£and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;U3and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;U3and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;Uöand the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Yahweh, were of burnished brass.UcIn the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.U{Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.UÖSolomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the show bread was, of gold;Uöand the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;UÓand the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.U¸Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh.t(NT  Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' [houses] of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion.UzAll the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.U?All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.U†They brought up the ark of Yahweh, and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.UΩKing Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.U¢The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.UzFor the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.U¢The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they are to this day.UªThere was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.UmIt came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh,U{so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh.UNThen spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.USI have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.UmThe king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.UâHe said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David your father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,UœSince the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.UfNow it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.UÜBut Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart:UÖnevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.UŸYahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.UòThere have I set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.UÅSolomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;UÀand he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;U®who have kept with your servant David my father that which you did promise him: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.T#  Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.UpNow therefore, God of Israel, Please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father.UïBut will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you;

and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.U÷If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there is blight [or] mildew, locust [or] caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there be;U∏whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man, [or] by all your people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:UÕthen hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know;

there is none else.ULet your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.UCThe king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.UÍSolomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand head of cattle, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.T]  The same day did the king make the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.UÀSo Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.U—On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant, and to Israel his people.t(NUñIt happened, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,UUthat Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.UÁYahweh said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me: I have made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.UŒAs for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;U≥then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, according as I promised to David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.U¬But if you shall turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;U“then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.UÆThough this house is so high, yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?UÌand they shall answer, Because they forsook Yahweh their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them: therefore has Yahweh brought all this evil on them.U{It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the king's houseU∆(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.UcHiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they didn't please him.UqHe said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother? He called them the land of Cabul to this day.U:Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.U≥This is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Yahweh, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.U∑Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife.U.Solomon built Gezer, and Beth Horon the lower,U6and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,UÍand all the storage cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.UöAs for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;U∞their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants to this day.U¬But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.UÜThese were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work.UÄBut Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which [Solomon] had built for her: then did he build Millo.UÀThree times a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh, burning incense therewith, [on the altar] that was before Yahweh. So he finished the house.UzKing Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.UhHiram sent in the navy his servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.UqThey came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.t(NU~When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Yahweh, she came to prove him with hard questions.U…She came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart.UiSolomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hidden from the king which he didn't tell her.U\When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,UÂand the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing, and his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her.UhShe said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.U™However I didn't believe the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and behold, the half was not told me; your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.UpHappy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, [and] who hear your wisdom.U∑Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because Yahweh loved Israel forever, therefore made he you king, to do justice and righteousness.UŒShe gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.U|The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones.UÃThe king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of Yahweh, and for the king's house, harps also and stringed instruments for the singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen, to this day.U√King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.UbNow the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,Uúbesides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people, and of the governors of the country.UiKing Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler.Uî[he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.UUMoreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.U∂There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.UzTwelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.U«All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.UÆFor the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.ULSo king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.UaAll the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.UòThey brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.U«Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.UâThe king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.UÄThe horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.U›A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.t(NUñNow king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;U„of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children of Israel, You shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon joined to these in love.UjHe had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.U∂For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as was the heart of David his father.UqFor Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.UrSolomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and didn't go fully after Yahweh, as did David his father.U´Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.UTSo did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.UYahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,UÑand had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he didn't keep that which Yahweh commanded.UÿTherefore Yahweh said to Solomon, Because this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.U|Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for David your father's sake: but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.UüHowever I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.U_Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.UäFor it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every male in EdomU](for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);U}that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.U…They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food, and gave him land.UäHadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.UôThe sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.U≥When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.UûThen Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country? He answered, Nothing: however only let me depart.UvGod raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.U¢He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.UçHe was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.U†Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.UçThis was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.U§The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph.U“It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.URAhijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.U™He said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to youUí(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);T5  because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my ordinances, as did David his father.U√However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;U\but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.UúTo his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.UlI will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.T*  It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.U;I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.UöSolomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.UÅNow the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren't they written in the book of the acts of Solomon?UKThe time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.UzSolomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.t(NUORehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.U£It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,Upand they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,U¶Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.UWHe said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. The people departed.U™King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people?UπThey spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.UòBut he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.U©He said to them, What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that your father did put on us lighter?T	  The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus you shall speak to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.UöNow whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.UxSo Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.UfThe king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,U∆and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.UøSo the king didn't listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh, that he might establish his word, which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.T
  When all Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.U_But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.U Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.U:So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.U·It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.T  When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.U<But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,UáSpeak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,T   Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the word of Yahweh, and returned and went their way, according to the word of Yahweh.U|Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived therein; and he went out from there, and built Penuel.UNJeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David:UÁif this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.U∆Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.U6He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.UVThis thing became a sin; for the people went [to worship] before the one, even to Dan.UlHe made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.T  Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; so did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.UıHe went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.t(NUÜBehold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.T  He cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh, and said, altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men's bones shall they burn on you.U°He gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar shall be torn, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.T  It happened, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. His hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.UçThe altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Yahweh.UÌThe king answered the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. The man of God entreated Yahweh, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.UgThe king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.UòThe man of God said to the king, If you will give me half your house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;Uãfor so was it commanded me by the word of Yahweh, saying, You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that you came.ULSo he went another way, and didn't return by the way that he came to Bethel.UﬁNow there lived an old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken to the king, them also they told to their father.UyTheir father said to them, Which way did he go? Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah.U_He said to his sons, Saddle me the donkey. So they saddled him the donkey; and he rode thereon.UêHe went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah?

[But] he lied to him.UFSo he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.UhIt happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back;UŒand he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you,U±but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.UñIt happened, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the donkey, [to wit], for the prophet whom he had brought back.UõWhen he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him: and his body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.UûBehold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.T  When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh: therefore Yahweh has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to him.UDHe spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the donkey. They saddled it.UìHe went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the donkey.U¶The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.UYHe laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, [saying], Alas, my brother!U≥It happened, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.U∑For the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely happen.U“After this thing Jeroboam didn't return from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.UxThis thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth.t(NU2At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.UÌJeroboam said to his wife, Please get up and disguise yourself, that you not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get you to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people.UxTake with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him: he will tell you what shall become of the child.UùJeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah.

Behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What are you doing here, Elijah?U˛He said, I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.UãYahweh said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you come, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria;Uûand you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your room.UãIt shall happen, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha kill.UÖYet will I leave [me] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.U∆So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke [of oxen] before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle on him.UªHe left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you. He said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to you?UÁHe returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.t(NU∫Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.U_He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, Thus says Ben Hadad,U^Your silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.UnThe king of Israel answered, It is according to your saying, my lord, O king; I am yours, and all that I have.UµThe messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben Hadad, saying, I sent indeed to you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;UÎbut I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.UﬂThen the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Please notice how this man seeks mischief: for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn't deny him.UQAll the elders and all the people said to him, Don't you listen, neither consent.U‹Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you did send for to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. The messengers departed, and brought him word again.UôBen Hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.UrThe king of Israel answered, Tell him, Don't let him who girds on [his armor] boast himself as he who puts it off.U”It happened, when [Ben Hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set [yourselves in array]. They set [themselves in array] against the city.UœBehold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus says Yahweh, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.UúAhab said, By whom? He said, Thus says Yahweh, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? He answered, You.UÀThen he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.UàThey went out at noon. But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him.UïThe young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria.UvHe said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they are come out for war, taken them alive.UoSo these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.UéThey killed everyone his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.UoThe king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.UøThe prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.UÃThe servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.U_Do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;U„and number you an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. He listened to their voice, and did so.UzIt happened at the return of the year, that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.U∆The children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.T  A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus says Yahweh, Because the Syrians have said, Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.U»They encamped one over against the other seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed of the Syrians one hundred thousand footmen in one day.UßBut the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.U˚His servants said to him, See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray you, put sackcloth on our bodies, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save your life.U–So they girded sackcloth on their bodies, and [put] ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Ben Hadad says, please let me live. He said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.UËNow the men observed diligently, and hurried to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Your brother Ben Hadad. Then he said, Go you, bring him. Then Ben Hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.T  [Ben Hadad] said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. I, [said Ahab], will let you go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.UÑA certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh, Please strike me. The man refused to strike him.U–Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall kill you. As soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and killed him.UdThen he found another man, and said, Please strike me. The man struck him, smiting and wounding him.UsSo the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.T.  As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.UäAs your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. The king of Israel said to him, So your judgment shall be; yourself have decided it.UwHe hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.U¿He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.UKThe king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.t(NUåIt happened after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.UÙAhab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house; and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to you, I will give you its worth in money.UbNaboth said to Ahab, Yahweh forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.UˇAhab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. He laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.UdBut Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?U„He said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you [another] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.U∞Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.U´So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, [and] who lived with Naboth.U[She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:U†and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, You did curse God and the king. Then carry him out, and stone him to death.U≤The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.U@They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.T  The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.UAThen they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.UÏIt happened, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.UìIt happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.U7The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,UõArise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to take possession of it.UÈYou shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Have you killed and also taken possession? You shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.U†Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, my enemy? He answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh.U¡Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel:U—and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.U[Of Jezebel also spoke Yahweh, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.UrHim who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.Uá(But there was none like Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.UáHe did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.)UñIt happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.U7The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,U≤See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days will I bring the evil on his house.t(NU@They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.UbIt happened in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.UôThe king of Israel said to his servants, "You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are still, and don't take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?"U¥He said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead? Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.UTJehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.UÎThen the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? They said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.U_But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?UÓThe king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. Jehoshaphat said, "Don't let the king say so."UZThen the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.U›Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.UëZedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus says Yahweh, With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.UÇAll the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.U‘The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, See now, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth: please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak you good.UIMicaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that will I speak.U”When he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? He answered him, Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.UyThe king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?U≠He said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Yahweh said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.UrThe king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?U•[Micaiah] said, "Therefore hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.UåYahweh said, 'Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?' One said on this manner; and another said on that manner.URThere came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said, 'I will entice him.'U¡Yahweh said to him, 'How?' He said, 'I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' He said, 'You shall entice him, and shall prevail also: go forth, and do so.'UâNow therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you."UïThen Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Yahweh from me to speak to you?UjMicaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.UxThe king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;Uñand say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.UqMicaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me. He said, Hear, you peoples, all of you.UQSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.U≤The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put you on your robes. The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.UõNow the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.U∑It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.UIt happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.U‡A certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded.U≤The battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.UÇThere went a cry throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.URSo the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.U±They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the prostitutes washed themselves [there]); according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke.U∆Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?UISo Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.U_Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.U°Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.UÍHe walked in all the way of Asa his father; He didn't turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh: however the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.U/Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.U¢Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?UgThe remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.U-There was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.UyJehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they didn't go; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber.UÄThen said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.UäJehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; Jehoram his son reigned in his place.UôAhaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.U¬He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made Israel to sin.U~He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.ttq(U2 Kings(NU5Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.UﬁAhaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.U‡But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?UÇNow therefore thus says Yahweh, You shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die. Elijah departed.UVThe messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why is it that you have returned?TI  They said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king who sent you, and tell him, Thus says Yahweh, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die.U]He said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?U{They answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a belt of leather about his waist. He said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.UøThen [the king] sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. He went up to him: and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. He spoke to him, man of God, the king has said, Come down.UºElijah answered to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty. Fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.UÑAgain he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty.

The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight.UïBehold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight.U{The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, Go down with him: don't be afraid of him.

  He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die.U¬So he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.U{Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?t(NUsIt happened, when Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.U∫Elijah said to Elisha, Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.

He said, "As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." They two went on.UsFifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.UóElijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground.UºIt happened, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you. Elisha said, please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.UîHe said, You have asked a hard thing: [nevertheless], if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be so.U¡It happened, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both apart; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.U±Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen! He saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.UlHe took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.U’He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah? and when he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over.U∆When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.UˆThey said to him, See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master, lest the Spirit of Yahweh has taken him up, and cast him on some mountain, or into some valley. He said, You shall not send.UàWhen they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but didn't find him.UhThey came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't go?'"U†The men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, we pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is bad, and the land miscarries.UJHe said, Bring me a new jar, and put salt therein.

Two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths.UJHe went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.t(NUêNow Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.UùHe did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.U}Nevertheless he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn't depart from it.UõNow Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams.U_But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.UGKing Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.UÏHe went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle?

It happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Yahweh came on him.U=He said, Thus says Yahweh, Make this valley full of trenches.U∏For thus says Yahweh, You shall not see wind, neither shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and you shall drink, both you and your livestock and your animals.UcThis is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.U™You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.UùIt happened in the morning, about the time of offering the offering, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.UºNow when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.UÑThey rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:Uäand they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.UÆWhen they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.T%  They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth [only] they left its stones; however the men armed with slings went about it, and struck it.UÆWhen the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.U‘Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.t(NU¯Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear Yahweh: and the creditor is come to take to him my two children to be bondservants.UòElisha said to her, What shall I do for you? tell me; what have you in the house? She said, Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.UhThen he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.UåYou shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and you shall set aside that which is full.UvSo she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.UïIt happened, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. He said to her, There isn't another vessel. The oil stayed.U|Then she came and told the man of God. He said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your sons of the rest.UøIt fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.UkShe said to her husband, See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.UƒLet us make, Please, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lamp stand: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there.USIt fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.UbHe said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. When he had called her, she stood before him.U„He said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army? She answered, I dwell among my own people.UqHe said, What then is to be done for her? Gehazi answered, Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old.UAHe said, Call her. When he had called her, she stood in the door.UêHe said, At this season, when the time comes round, you shall embrace a son. She said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.UhThe woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to her.UZWhen the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.UYHe said to his father, My head, my head. He said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.UdWhen he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.U`She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] on him, and went out.UíShe called to her husband, and said, Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.UfHe said, Why will you go to him today? it is neither new moon nor Sabbath. She said, It shall be well.UyThen she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; don't slacken me the riding, except I bid you.U±So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:Uêplease run now to meet her, and ask her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? She answered, It is well.UÔWhen she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hid it from me, and has not told me.UNThen she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Didn't I say, Do not deceive me?UﬂThen he said to Gehazi, Gird up your waist, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, Don't greet him; and if anyone greets you, don't answer him again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.UxThe mother of the child said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. He arose, and followed her.U…Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child has not awakened.UUWhen Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.UKHe went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.UæHe went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew warm.U´Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.U{He called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. When she was come in to him, he said, Take up your son.UoThen she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.U–Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.UæOne went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they didn't recognize them.U¥So they poured out for the men to eat. It happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out, and said, man of God, there is death in the pot. They could not eat of it.UçBut he said, Then bring meal. He cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. There was no harm in the pot.U…There came a man from Baal Shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, Give to the people, that they may eat.U≠His servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says Yahweh, They shall eat, and shall leave of it.UXSo he set it before them, and they ate, and left of it, according to the word of Yahweh.t(NU–Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, [but he was] a leper.UãThe Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman's wife.UShe said to her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.UcOne went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden who is of the land of Israel.U≈The king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of clothing.U∞He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.T  It happened, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.UËIt was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.UcSo Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.UéElisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.UÃBut Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.U§Aren't Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.U»His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? how much rather then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?U∫Then went he down, and dipped [himself] seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.U·He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, please take a present from your servant.UpBut he said, As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. He urged him to take it; but he refused.U…Naaman said, If not, yet, please let there be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth; for your servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.U˛In this thing Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.UBHe said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.U·But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.UàSo Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?UËHe said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; please give them a talent of silver, and two changes of clothing.U Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.UÅWhen he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.U~But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, Whence come you, Gehazi? He said, Your servant went no where.UÛHe said to him, Didn't my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?UàThe leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to you, and to your seed forever. He went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.t(NUkThe sons of the prophets said to Elisha, See now, the place where we dwell before you is too strait for us.UíLet us go, we pray you, to the Jordan, and take there every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. He answered, Go you.USOne said, Be pleased, I pray you, to go with your servants. He answered, I will go.UGSo he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.U~But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed.UÑThe man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float.U7He said, "Take it." So he put out his hand and took it.UãNow the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.UÄThe man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you not pass such a place; for there the Syrians are coming down.UÖThe king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.UßThe heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Won't you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?UûOne of his servants said, No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.UoHe said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him. It was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.UpTherefore sent he there horses, and chariots, and a great army: and they came by night, and surrounded the city.UºWhen the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?U^He answered, Don't be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.UÃElisha prayed, and said, Yahweh, Please open his eyes, that he may see. Yahweh opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha.U¶When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, and said, Please smite this people with blindness. He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.UïElisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. He led them to Samaria.UŒIt happened, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Yahweh, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.UiThe king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I strike them? shall I strike them?U”He answered, You shall not strike them: would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.U≥He prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. The bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.UmIt happened after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.U…There was a great famine in Samaria: and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty [pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five [pieces] of silver.UlAs the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, there cried a woman to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.UrHe said, If Yahweh doesn't help you, whence shall I help you? out of the threshing floor, or out of the winepress?UîThe king said to her, What ails you? She answered, This woman said to me, Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.UÅSo we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, Give your son, that we may eat him; and she has hid her son.UøIt happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes (now he was passing by on the wall); and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth within on his flesh.UsThen he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.Tz  But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and [the king] sent a man from before him: but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See you how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him: isn't the sound of his master's feet behind him?U°While he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of Yahweh; why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?t(NUÀElisha said, Hear you the word of Yahweh: thus says Yahweh, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.U‚Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might this thing be? He said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it.UxNow there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?T  If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the army of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.U©They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.T  For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.UõTherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.T  When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it.UÍThen they said one to another, We aren't doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we hold our peace: if we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household.UÙSo they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.UGHe called the porters; and they told it to the king's household within.T,  The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.T  One of his servants answered, Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel who are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel who are consumed); and let us send and see.UrThey took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.UπThey went after them to the Jordan: and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king.UπThe people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Yahweh.UÕThe king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.U«It happened, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;Uœand that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? and he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it:UPit happened even so to him; for the people trod on him in the gate, and he died.t(NUÓNow Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for Yahweh has called for a famine; and it shall also come on the land seven years.UúThe woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.U¶It happened at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.UÖNow the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.T&  It happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, that behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.U’When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.U{Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come here.UöThe king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Yahweh by him, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?U˚So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?UqElisha said to him, Go, tell him, You shall surely recover; however Yahweh has shown me that he shall surely die.UXHe settled his gaze steadfastly [on him], until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.T  Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? He answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strongholds will you set on fire, and their young men will you kill with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.U§Hazael said, But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? Elisha answered, Yahweh has shown me that you shall be king over Syria.UñThen he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to you?

His mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.U®He walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.UwHe went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.T  King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.t(NU†Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up your waist, and take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.UØWhen you come there, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner chamber.U¢Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you king over Israel.

Jehu said, To which of us all? He said, To you, O captain.U¡He arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh, even over Israel.U≠You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel.U´For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel.UzI will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.UxThe dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. He opened the door, and fled.U≠Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? why came this mad fellow to you? He said to them, You know the man and what his talk was.UãThey said, It is false; tell us now. He said, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you king over Israel.UçThen they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king.U£So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;U˛but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.UvSo Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.U–Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?UÊSo there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me. The watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he isn't coming back.UßThen he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me.UüThe watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and isn't coming back: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.UŸJoram said, Make ready. They made ready his chariot. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.U©It happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? He answered, What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?USJoram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, Ahaziah.UíJehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.UﬁThen said [Jehu] to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him:UÁSurely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, says Yahweh; and I will requite you in this plat, says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat [of ground], according to the word of Yahweh.U˙But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot: [and they struck him] at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there.UuHis servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.UPIn the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.UÅWhen Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.UYAs Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, you Zimri, your master's murderer?UtHe lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? There looked out to him two or three eunuchs.UêHe said, Throw her down. So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.U}When he was come in, he ate and drink; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter.UnThey went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.U Therefore they came back, and told him. He said, This is the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;Uâand the body of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.t(NU±Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up [the sons of] Ahab, saying,UûNow as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;U|look you out the best and meet of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.UsBut they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings didn't stand before him: how then shall we stand?T  He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up [the children], sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, and will do all that you shall bid us; we will not make any man king: you do that which is good in your eyes.T6  Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you be on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.U≤It happened, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and killed them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.UØThere came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. He said, Lay you them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.U∏It happened in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him; but who struck all these?U∫Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of Yahweh, which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.U•So Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.UhHe arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds in the way,U Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you? They answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah: and we go down to Greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.UñHe said, Take them alive. They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.T-  When he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he greeted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.UXHe said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh. So they made him ride in his chariot.UûWhen he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to Elijah.UqJehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.T&  Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice [to do] to Baal; whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.UCJehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. They proclaimed it.U“Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn't come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.UHe said to him who was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.

and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and its pattern, according to all its workmanship.U©Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.UwWhen the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near to the altar, and offered thereon.UèHe burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, on the altar.U±The bronze altar, which was before Yahweh, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Yahweh, and put it on the north side of his altar.T≤  King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meal offering, and the king's burnt offering, and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.UDUrijah the priest did so, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.UµKing Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone.U°The covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry outside, turned he to the house of Yahweh, because of the king of Assyria.UwNow the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?U}Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.t(NUÅIn the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, [and reigned] nine years.UfHe did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.UhAgainst him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.UÔThe king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.UnThen the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.U¡In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.UƒIt was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,Uêand walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.U√The children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;UXand they set them up pillars and Asherim on every high hill, and under every green tree;Ußand there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;UUand they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, You shall not do this thing.T  Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn you from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.UÜNotwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn't believe in Yahweh their God.T)  They rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and [went] after the nations that were around them, concerning whom Yahweh had commanded them that they should not do like them.U±They forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served Baal.U…They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.UÄTherefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.UrAlso Judah didn't keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.UíYahweh rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.U©For he tore Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.UeThe children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn't depart from them;U§until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.UÙThe king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in the cities of it.UïSo it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn't fear Yahweh: therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.T)  Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, don't know the law of the god of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them, because they don't know the law of the god of the land.UøThen the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.UÑSo one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh.U´However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.UkThe men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,Uìand the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.UìSo they feared Yahweh, and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.UzThey feared Yahweh, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.UÛTo this day they do after the former manner: they don't fear Yahweh, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;U£with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and commanded them, saying, You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:Uøbut Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, him you shall fear, and to him you shall bow yourselves, and to him you shall sacrifice:U•and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forevermore; and you shall not fear other gods:Ucand the covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget; neither shall you fear other gods:U`but you shall fear Yahweh your God; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.UDHowever they did not listen, but they did after their former manner.UßSo these nations feared Yahweh, and served their engraved images; their children likewise, and their children's children, as did their fathers, so do they to this day.t(NUÉNow it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.UúHe was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.UcHe did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done.UËHe removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.UëHe trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor [among them] that were before him.UxFor he joined with Yahweh; he didn't depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses.U|Yahweh was with him; wherever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and didn't serve him.UhHe struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.UºIt happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.UåAt the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.UêThe king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,U≠because they didn't obey the voice of Yahweh their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.UçNow in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.T  Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. The king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.UsHezekiah gave [him] all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king's house.U∫At that time did Hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of Yahweh, and [from] the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.T  The king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.U∞When they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.UãRabshakeh said to them, Say you now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?UêYou say (but they are but vain words), [There is] counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?UΩNow, behold, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.U”But if you tell me, We trust in Yahweh our God; isn't that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?U°Now therefore, Please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.UìHow then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?U}Am I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.UÙThen said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and don't speak with us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.U”But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? Hasn't he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?UïThen Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear you the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.UkThus says the king, Don't let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand:Uúneither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.U€Don't listen to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat you everyone of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern;T  Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and don't listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, Yahweh will deliver us.UbHas any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?UçWhere are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?UòWho are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?UwBut the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, saying, Don't answer him.U Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.t(NUäIt happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh.U°He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.U∂They said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.U˚It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.U0So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.UºIsaiah said to them, Thus you shall tell your master, Thus says Yahweh, Don't be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.UòBehold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear news, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.UÄSo Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.UäWhen he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,U¥Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Don't let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.UÄBehold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you be delivered?UõHave the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?UoWhere is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?UîHezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh.UƒHezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sit [above] the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.UöIncline your ear, Yahweh, and hear; open your eyes, Yahweh, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, with which he has sent him to defy the living God.UUOf a truth, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,Uèand have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.UíNow therefore, Yahweh our God, save you us, I beg you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you Yahweh are God alone.U±Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard [you].U≠This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.UôWhom have you defied and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel.TL  By your messengers you have defied the Lord, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars of it, and the choice fir trees of it; and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field.UhI have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.U∑Haven't you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.U⁄Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.UaBut I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me.U‘Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.U⁄This shall be the sign to you: You shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat its fruit.UiThe remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.UÉFor out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape: the zeal of Yahweh shall perform this.U¡Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.UfBy the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come to this city, says Yahweh.UYFor I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.U”It happened that night, that the angel of Yahweh went forth, and struck in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred eighty-five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.UUSo Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.U–It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.t(NU∂In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Set your house in order: for you shall die, and not live.UBThen he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying,U§Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. Hezekiah wept sore.UvIt happened, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Yahweh came to him, saying,UÈTurn back, and tell Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of Yahweh.U¡I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.UVIsaiah said, Take a cake of figs. They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.UÜHezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of Yahweh the third day?U¶Isaiah said, This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?U~Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.UÄIsaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.UòAt that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.T.  Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn't show them.U∫Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to you? Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.U¶He said, What have they seen in your house? Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.U1Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Yahweh.U∂Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, says Yahweh.UìOf your sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall father, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.UñThen said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of Yahweh which you have spoken. He said moreover, Isn't it so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?UÕNow the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?UKHezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his place.t(NUàManasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hephzibah.UåHe did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.U÷For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.U^He built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.UUHe built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.U›He made his son to pass through the fire, and practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.UÏHe set the engraved image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Yahweh said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever;Uˆneither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.UôBut they didn't listen: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.U2Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,U∂Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols;Uñtherefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.UØI will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.UûI will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;Uúbecause they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.UÕMoreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.UüNow the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?UçManasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his place.U§Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.UNHe did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father.UtHe walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them:UTand he forsook Yahweh, the God of his fathers, and didn't walk in the way of Yahweh.UWThe servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.UíBut the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.UwNow the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?UYHe was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his place.t(NU•Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign;

for they dealt faithfully.U£Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh. Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.U˜Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh.UvShaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. Shaphan read it before the king.U`It happened, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes.U£The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,T3  Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.T  So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her.U[She said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Tell you the man who sent you to me,UìThus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.U·Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.U¶But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: As touching the words which you have heard,T  because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.U‘Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place. They brought the king word again.t(NUQThe king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.T)  The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Yahweh.T5  The king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all [his] heart, and all [his] soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.Tj  The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Yahweh all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky, and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.T  He put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of the sky.UÕHe brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves of the common people.U{He broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Yahweh, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.TB  He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.UìNevertheless the priests of the high places didn't come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.UòHe defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.U·He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Yahweh, by the chamber of Nathan Melech the officer, who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.T  The altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Yahweh, did the king break down, and beat [them] down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.T9  The high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.UhHe broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.U¯Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.T  As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.U—Then he said, What monument is that which I see? The men of the city told him, It is the tomb of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.UÉHe said, Let him be; let no man move his bones.

So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.U·But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Think you that David does honor your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Aren't his servants come to you to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?UÜSo Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.UÕThen there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, Stay at Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return.UÒWhen the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.U÷So they hired them thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.UIWhen David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.UêThe children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.UùNow when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.UâThe rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.UëHe said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.UÄBe of good courage, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh do that which seems him good.UnSo Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.U†When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.U≈When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.U‰It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came on them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.UÆThe Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians [the men of] seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.U∞When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.t(NT  It happened, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out [to battle], that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.UﬂDavid took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.U‘He brought forth the people who were therein, and cut [them] with saws, and with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.U®It happened after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.U©There was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.UºThere was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were twenty-four, six [on each hand], and six [on each foot]; and he also was born to the giant.UMWhen he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother killed him.UjThese were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.t(NU@Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.UñDavid said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.U—Joab said, Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, aren't they all my lord's servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?UÑNevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.UœJoab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword.U]But he didn't count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab.U?God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.U•David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.U*Yahweh spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,UwGo and speak to David, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose one of them, that I may do it to you.UJSo Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Take your choice:TQ  either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.UúDavid said to Gad, I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.UUSo Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.T  God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay your hand. The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.UﬁDavid lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.T0  David said to God, Isn't it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father's house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.UôThen the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David, that David should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.UIDavid went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.UxOrnan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.UêAs David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.UÿThen David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh: for the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.UÙOrnan said to David, Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: behold, I give [you] the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering; I give it all.UØKing David said to Ornan, No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.UKSo David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.UµDavid built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.UJYahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.UÅAt that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.UëFor the tabernacle of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.UqBut David couldn't go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.t(NUeThen David said, This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.UìDavid commanded to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build the house of God.UàDavid prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;Umand cedar trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.T  David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it.

So Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in the house of God:Uªthe two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,U£and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.U<He made also the bases, and the basins made he on the bases;U&one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.UóThe pots also, and the shovels, and the forks, and all its vessels, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of Yahweh of bright brass.UbIn the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.UkThus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.U~Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them;Uhand the lampstands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;UNand the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;Uﬂand the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold.t(NUÛThus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.UÚThen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' [houses] of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion.UjAnd all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was [in] the seventh month.U?All the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;Uëand they brought up the ark, and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.UµKing Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.U¢The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.UzFor the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.UòThe poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there it is to this day.U®There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put [there] at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.U°It happened, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their divisions;T!  also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)Tr  it happened, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, [saying], For he is good; for his loving kindness endures forever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Yahweh,Uxso that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God.t(NUNThen spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.UTBut I have built you a house of habitation, and a place for you to dwell in forever.UgThe king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.UàHe said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,U‰Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:Ulbut I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.UfNow it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.UÜBut Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart:UÖnevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.U◊Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.UhThere have I set the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with the children of Israel.UmHe stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his handsT  (for Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;)UΩand he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven, or on earth; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;U®who have kept with your servant David my father that which you did promise him: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.T#  Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.UkNow therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David.UôBut will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you; how much less this house which I have built!UßYet have you respect to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you;UÃthat your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place.UΩListen to the petitions of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.UçIf a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house;U«then hear from heaven, and do, and judge your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his way on his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.U¡If your people Israel be struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;Uèthen hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.UæWhen the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you do afflict them:UÂthen hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.U÷If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities;

and the glory of Yahweh filled the house.UhThe priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh, because the glory of Yahweh filled Yahweh's house.T   All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Yahweh was on the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, [saying], For he is good; for his loving kindness endures for ever.UAThen the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Yahweh.U´King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.T2  The priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, (for his loving kindness endures for ever), when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.T%  Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat.UïSo Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.U~On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.UœOn the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.U∑Thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh, and the king's house: and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of Yahweh, and in his own house.UéYahweh appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.UÜIf I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;U“if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.U[Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.UáFor now have I chosen and made this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.U£As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;U°then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.UìBut if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;U‹then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.UïThis house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?UÓThey shall answer, Because they abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them: therefore has he brought all this evil on them.t(NUjIt happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh, and his own house,Uwthat the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.U7Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it.UXHe built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath.UlAlso he built Beth Horon the upper, and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;U˘and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.UñAs for all the people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel;Uùof their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn't consume, of them did Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day.U≠But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.UaThese were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.UÙSolomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where the ark of Yahweh has come are holy.UkThen Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh, which he had built before the porch,T  even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, [even] in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents.TB  He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.UÇThey didn't depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.U†Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh, and until it was finished. [So] the house of Yahweh was completed.UTThen went Solomon to Ezion Geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.UÓHuram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.t(NT'  When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart.UiSolomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he didn't tell her.UXWhen the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,U˙and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing, his cup bearers also, and their clothing, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her.UhShe said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.U¥However I didn't believe their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: you exceed the fame that I heard.UnHappy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom.UÏBlessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on his throne, to be king for Yahweh your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore made he you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.U∫She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.U~The servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.U—The king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Yahweh, and for the king's house, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers: and there were none like these seen before in the land of Judah.U∫King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.UfNow the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,Uñbesides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.UpKing Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of beaten gold went to one buckler.U†[he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred [shekels] of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.UOMoreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.U¿And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.UzTwelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.U∂All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.UµFor the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.UISo king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.UnAll the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.UîThey brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.U†Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.UkHe ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.UâThe king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.UCThey brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.UÂNow the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren't they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?U9Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.U}Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.t(NUORehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.U©It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.U_They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,U¶Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.UHHe said to them, Come again to me after three days. The people departed.U™King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people?UíThey spoke to him, saying, If you are kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.UòBut he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.U¶He said to them, What counsel give you, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that your father did put on us lighter?T  The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus you shall say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.UúNow whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.UxSo Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.UUThe king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,U√and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.U¥So the king didn't listen to the people; for it was brought about of God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.T  When all Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, Israel: now see to your own house, David. So all Israel departed to their tents.U_But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.U◊Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.U:So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.t(NUŒWhen Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.U?But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,UeSpeak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,U“Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the words of Yahweh, and returned from going against Jeroboam.UCRehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.U(He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,U Beth Zur, and Soco, and Adullam,U!and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,U%and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,UYand Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.U]He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, and oil and wine.UnIn every city [he put] shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.U[The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.UæFor the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office to Yahweh;Uoand he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made.U¨After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.U°So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.UÜRehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, [and of] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;U7and she bore him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.UnAfter her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.U…Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)UÑRehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, [even] the prince among his brothers; for [he was minded] to make him king.UºHe dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them food in abundance. He sought [for them] many wives.t(NUâIt happened, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him.UëIt happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Yahweh,U•with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.UMHe took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.UÙNow Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, You have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.U_Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Yahweh is righteous.T  When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.UyNevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.UﬁSo Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king's house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.UòKing Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.UíIt was so, that as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.UòWhen he humbled himself, the wrath of Yahweh turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things [found].T4  So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.UKHe did that which was evil, because he didn't set his heart to seek Yahweh.UÿNow the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren't they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.UnRehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his place.t(NUIIn the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.UíThree years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.U÷Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.UwAbijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:UóOught you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?UoYet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.U¡There were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.UºNow you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.T  Haven't you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands? so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, the same may be a priest of [those who are] no gods.UûBut as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and [we have] priests ministering to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:T   and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense: the show bread also [set they] in order on the pure table; and the lampstand of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening: for we keep the instruction of Yahweh our God; but you have forsaken him.U’Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don't you fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers; for you shall not prosper.UsBut Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.UãWhen Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.UíThen the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened, that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.UQThe children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.U~Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.UöThus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.UáAbijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns.UfNeither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Yahweh struck him, and he died.U|But Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.UqThe rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.t(NUõSo Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years.UDAsa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God:Uofor he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and cut down the Asherim,Udand commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.UzAlso he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.UÄHe built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest.T  For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.U Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.UÜThere came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops, and three hundred chariots; and he came to Mareshah.UgThen Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.T  Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, Yahweh, there is none besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength: help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God; don't let man prevail against you.UVSo Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.UÔAsa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh, and before his army; and they carried away very much booty.UíThey struck all the cities around Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came on them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.UtThey struck also the tents of livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.t(NU2The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded:U‚and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Yahweh is with you, while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.UfNow for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:UjBut when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.UãIn those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands.UsThey were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with all adversity.UVBut be you strong, and don't let your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.T/  When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Yahweh, that was before the porch of Yahweh.U÷He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.UpSo they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.UÇThey sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep.UvThey entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;UÄand that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.U_They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.U∞All Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Yahweh gave them rest all around.U—Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.UnBut the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.UåHe brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.UIThere was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.t(NU∫In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.U≠Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king's house, and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,U–[There is] a league between me and you, as [there was] between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.U∑Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.U^It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.U°Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.U„At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.U£Weren't the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because you did rely on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand.UﬁFor the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly; for from henceforth you shall have wars.U§Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.UoBehold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.U•In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he didn't seek Yahweh, but to the physicians.UOAsa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.U¸They buried him in his own tombs, which he had dug out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds [of spices] prepared by the perfumers' art: and they made a very great burning for him.t(NURJehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.UúHe placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.UpYahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn't seek the Baals,Uhbut sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.UçTherefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.UyHis heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.UüAlso in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;U›and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.UöThey taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Yahweh with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.U~The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.UÀSome of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats.UVJehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.U\He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.U≥This was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;UPand next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;Uäand next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.UgOf Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;UZand next to him Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war.UvThese were those who waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.t(NUTNow Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.U¡After certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up [with him] to Ramoth Gilead.U¬Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead? He answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your people; and [we will be] with you in the war.UTJehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.U‹Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? They said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.U_But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?U˝The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh: but I hate him; for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. Jehoshaphat said, Don't let the king say so.UYThen the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.UÍNow the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.UêZedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus says Yahweh, With these you shall push the Syrians, until they be consumed.UÇAll the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.U‘The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth: let your word therefore, Please be like one of theirs, and speak you good.UCMicaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what my God says, that will I speak.U¡When he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? He said, Go up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.UyThe king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?U≠He said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Yahweh said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.UrThe king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?U¢[Micaiah] said, "Therefore hear you the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.U´Yahweh said, 'Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?' One spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.UmThere came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said, 'I will entice him.' Yahweh said to him, 'How?'U¶He said, 'I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' He said, 'You shall entice him, and shall prevail also: go forth, and do so.'UÖNow therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you."UïThen Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Yahweh from me to speak to you?UjMicaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.UxThe king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;Uòand say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.UqMicaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me. He said, Hear, you peoples, all of you.UQSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.U∫The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put you on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.UêNow the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.UˆIt happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Yahweh helped him; and God moved them [to depart] from him.UIt happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.U‹A certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am sore wounded.U∑The battle increased that day: however the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.t(NUJJehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.U¬Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should you help the wicked, and love those who hate Yahweh? for this thing wrath is on you from before Yahweh.UçNevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God.U∞Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.UUHe set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,UÄand said to the judges, Consider what you do: for you don't judge for man, but for Yahweh; and [he is] with you in the judgment.U†Now therefore let the fear of Yahweh be on you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Yahweh our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.UÕMoreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers' [houses] of Israel, for the judgment of Yahweh, and for controversies.

and aren't you ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in your hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand you.UèDid not you, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham your friend forever?UQThey lived therein, and have built you a sanctuary therein for your name, saying,U”If evil come on us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before you, (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.UƒNow, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and didn't destroy them;Ujbehold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.UùOur God, will you not judge them?

Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.U Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.UπIt happened, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and killed them.T  He sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and killed him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart. The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.UÑNow when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah.T]  But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she didn't kill him.UWHe was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.t(NT
  In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.UúThey went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers' [houses] of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.U´All the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. He said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David.UúThis is the thing that you shall do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;U†and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Yahweh.UƒBut let none come into the house of Yahweh, save the priests, and those who minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the instruction of Yahweh.U¡The Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house, let him be slain: and be you with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.T   So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest didn't dismiss the shift.UúJehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.U∞He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king.UΩThen they brought out the king's son, and put the crown on him, and [gave him] the testimony, and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said, [Long] live the king.U{When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Yahweh:TC  and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also [played] on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!U˛Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, Have her forth between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Don't kill her in the house of Yahweh.UxSo they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king's house: and they killed her there.UpJehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Yahweh's people.U£All the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.T$  Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Yahweh under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Yahweh, to offer the burnt offerings of Yahweh, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.UpHe set the porters at the gates of the house of Yahweh, that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in.T  He took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Yahweh: and they came through the upper gate to the king's house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom.UgSo all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword.t(NUäJoash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zibiah, of Beersheba.UYJoash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest.UPJehoiada took for him two wives; and he became the father of sons and daughters.UMIt happened after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Yahweh.U˙He gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that you hasten the matter. However the Levites didn't hurry.UÙThe king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why haven't you required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?U£For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of Yahweh did they bestow on the Baals.UdSo the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of Yahweh.UîThey made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.UqAll the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.TF  It was so, that whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.UÁThe king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh, and also such as worked iron and brass to repair the house of Yahweh.UëSo the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.TG  When they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of Yahweh, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh continually all the days of Jehoiada.UjBut Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died; one hundred thirty years old was he when he died.UwThey buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.UzNow after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.U¢They forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.UzYet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to Yahweh; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.T  The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them, Thus says God, Why disobey you the commandments of Yahweh, so that you can't prosper? because you have forsaken Yahweh, he has also forsaken you.UzThey conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Yahweh.U©Thus Joash the king didn't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. When he died, he said, Yahweh look on it, and require it.UˆIt happened at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.U’For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment on Joash.T  When they were departed for him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they didn't bury him in the tombs of the kings.UÖThese are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.U€Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens [laid] on him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. Amaziah his son reigned in his place.t(NUõAmaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.UPHe did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, but not with a perfect heart.UyNow it happened, when the kingdom was established to him, that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father.T  But he didn't put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.TV  Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers' houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, who could handle spear and shield.UgHe hired also one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver.U®But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, don't let the army of Israel go with you; for Yahweh is not with Israel, [to wit], with all the children of Ephraim.UìBut if you will go, do [valiantly], be strong for the battle: God will cast you down before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to cast down.UøAmaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? The man of God answered, Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.U«Then Amaziah separated them, [to wit], the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.UÄAmaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck of the children of Seir ten thousand.Uæ[other] ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.U—But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil.U‚Now it happened, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.U◊Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?T!  It happened, as he talked with him, that [the king] said to him, Have we made you of the king's counsel? Stop! Why should you be struck down? Then the prophet stopped, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.U¢Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.T  Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife: and there passed by a wild animal that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.UπYou say, Behold, you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast: abide now at home; why should you meddle to [your] hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?UõBut Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand [of their enemies], because they had sought after the gods of Edom.UâSo Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.UBJudah was defeated by Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.UÏJoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.UΩ[He took] all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.UsAmaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.U~Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren't they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?U≈Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Yahweh they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.UQThey brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.t(NUtAll the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.UUHe built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.UîSixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.UeHe did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.UöHe set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Yahweh, God made him to prosper.UÕHe went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in [the country of] Ashdod, and among the Philistines.UgGod helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunim.U}The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he grew exceeding strong.UãMoreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning [of the wall], and fortified them.UÏHe built towers in the wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock; in the lowland also, and in the plain: [and he had] farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved farming.U‡Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, who went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.UsThe whole number of the heads of fathers' [houses], even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.UùUnder their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.UàUzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.U‡He made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, until he was strong.U√But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Yahweh his God; for he went into the temple of Yahweh to burn incense on the altar of incense.UbAzariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men:T   and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It pertains not to you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall it be for your honor from Yahweh God.U‡Then Uzziah was angry; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Yahweh, beside the altar of incense.UŸAzariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there; yes, himself hurried also to go out, because Yahweh had struck him.U›Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.UcNow the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.U¡So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his place.t(NUùJotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.UµHe did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: however he didn't enter into the temple of Yahweh. The people did yet corruptly.UWHe built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.UfMoreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.T:  He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render to him, in the second year also, and in the third.UKSo Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God.UäNow the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.U`He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.UoJotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.t(NU∞Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he didn't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, like David his father;U\but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baals.U¬Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.UaHe sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.T  Therefore Yahweh his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they struck him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with a great slaughter.U™For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers.UäZichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king.U∫The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.T/  But a prophet of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because Yahweh, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.UπNow you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids to you: [but] aren't there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God?UäNow hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you have taken captive of your brothers; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you.U·Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,UÔand said to them, You shall not bring in the captives here: for you purpose that which will bring on us a trespass against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.UYSo the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.Tn  The men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers: then they returned to Samaria.UDAt that time did king Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria to help him.ULFor again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives.UÒThe Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with its towns, and Timnah with its towns, Gimzo also and its towns: and they lived there.UàFor Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed severely against Yahweh.U\Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but didn't strengthen him.U©For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria: but it didn't help him.UYIn the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Yahweh, this same king Ahaz.UÏFor he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, [therefore] will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.UÕAhaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.UIn every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of his fathers.UÇNow the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.UºAhaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they didn't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.t(NU¶Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.UcHe did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done.UrHe in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, and repaired them.UgHe brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,U±and said to them, Hear me, you Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.UÃFor our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs.U•Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.U±Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed back and forth, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.UzFor, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.UuNow it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.UõMy sons, don't be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and that you should be his ministers, and burn incense.T  Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;Uband of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;U^and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.U¶They gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Yahweh, to cleanse the house of Yahweh.T   The priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Yahweh into the court of the house of Yahweh.

They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.T  Then Hezekiah answered, Now you have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of Yahweh. The assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart [brought] burnt offerings.UßThe number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh.UPThe consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep.T#  But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: therefore their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.UøAlso the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of Yahweh was set in order.U~Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.t(NUƒHezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel.U}For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.U≤For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.UDThe thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.T  So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.TP  So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, You children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that have escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.U£Don't be you like your fathers, and like your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see.U‹Now don't you be stiff-necked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.T  For if you turn again to Yahweh, your brothers and your children shall find compassion before those who led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.UçSo the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun: but they ridiculed them, and mocked them.UhNevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.UÜAlso on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Yahweh.UzThere assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.UèThey arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.U…Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh.U¨They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood [which they received] of the hand of the Levites.U¿For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Yahweh.U˙For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Yahweh pardon everyoneUÖwho sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, though not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.U3Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.U›The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day, [singing] with loud instruments to Yahweh.U¸Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding [in the service] of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.UiThe whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.UÒFor Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.U¬All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.UáSo there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.UñThen the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.t(NTÉ  Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.T  Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Yahweh.T  [He appointed] also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Yahweh.U°Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh.UÁAs soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.U›The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God, and laid them by heaps.UiIn the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.UaWhen Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh, and his people Israel.UJThen Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.T  Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since [the people] began to bring the offerings into the house of Yahweh, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Yahweh has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.U[Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh; and they prepared them.U°They brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.T  Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.U©Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east [gate], was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the offerings of Yahweh, and the most holy things.U⁄Under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, as well to the great as to the small:UÔbesides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into the house of Yahweh, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions;U®and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;U◊and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.T
  Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.UuHezekiah did so throughout all Judah; and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before Yahweh his God.U¶In every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.t(NU¥After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.UaWhen Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,Uähe took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city; and they helped him.U…So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the springs, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?UÿHe took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised [it] up to the towers, and the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo [in] the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.UúHe set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,U≠Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:U•with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us, and to fight our battles. The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.UŒAfter this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying,UcThus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do you trust, that you abide the siege in Jerusalem?UüDoes not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?UµHas not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn incense?U∞Don't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?UøWho was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?T  Now therefore don't let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe you him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?UQHis servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God, and against his servant Hezekiah.T  He wrote also letters, to rail on Yahweh, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.U©They cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.UrThey spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.UgHezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.T)  Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. When he was come into the house of his god, those who came forth from his own bowels killed him there with the sword.UØThus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all [others], and guided them on every side.UûMany brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.UqIn those days Hezekiah was sick even to death: and he prayed to Yahweh; and he spoke to him, and gave him a sign.U°But Hezekiah didn't render again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem.U∑Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh didn't come on them in the days of Hezekiah.U∆Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;U{storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of animals, and flocks in folds.U}Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.U≥This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.U”However in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.UµNow the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.U◊Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place.t(NUcManasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.UåHe did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.UøFor he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.UdHe built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, In Jerusalem shall my name be forever.UUHe built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.T$  He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.UÛHe set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever:UÛneither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances [given] by Moses.UùManasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.UCYahweh spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.U¶Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.UmWhen he was in distress, he begged Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.U™He prayed to him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh he was God.T  Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he encircled Ophel [with it], and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.U≈He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Yahweh, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.UüHe built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.UZNevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God.U÷Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.T  His prayer also, and how [God] was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.UpSo Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his place.U\Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.U≤He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.UÄHe didn't humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.UJHis servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.UíBut the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.t(NU`Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.UñHe did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in the ways of David his father, and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left.T  For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten images.T)  They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the incense altars that were on high above them he cut down; and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves [of those] who had sacrificed to them.URHe burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.Uf[So did he] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins.UµHe broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.UÓNow in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his God.T.  They came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.UµThey delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house;U≠even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy cut stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.T  The men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and [others of] the Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music.UÆAlso they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.UìWhen they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh [given] by Moses.UÑHilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh. Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.UíShaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.UûThey have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.U{Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. Shaphan read therein before the king.UTIt happened, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes.UïThe king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,T*  Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do according to all that is written in this book.UˇSo Hilkiah, and they whom the king [had commanded], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to her to that effect.U[She said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Tell you the man who sent you to me,U≤Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.U⁄Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched.U¶But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: As touching the words which you have heard,T	  because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.U‚Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on its inhabitants. They brought back word to the king.UOThen the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.T  The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.T
  The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.U•He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [to it]. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.T	  Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they didn't depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.t(NUwJosiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem: and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.U_He set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Yahweh.T  He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden on your shoulders: now serve Yahweh your God, and his people Israel.U£Prepare yourselves after your fathers' houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.U¿Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your brothers the children of the people, and [let there be for each] a portion of a fathers' house of the Levites.UzKill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of Yahweh by Moses.UÈJosiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls: these were of the king's substance.T  His princes gave for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred [small livestock], and three hundred head of cattle.UËConaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand [small livestock], and five hundred head of cattle.UãSo the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king's commandment.UThey killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood which they received] of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.U‰They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses. So did they with the cattle.U≈They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.UˇAfterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busied] in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.T  The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate: they didn't need to depart from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.UØSo all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh, according to the commandment of king Josiah.UuThe children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.T  There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.UEIn the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.UûAfter all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.T  But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? [I come] not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; and God has commanded me to make haste: forbear you from [meddling with] God, who is with me, that he not destroy you.U‘Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and didn't listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.UhThe archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.UﬁSo his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.U◊Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and behold, they are written in the lamentations.UpNow the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh,Udand his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.t(NUrThen the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's place in Jerusalem.UcJoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.UrThe king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.U§The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim.

but his power and his wrath is against all those who forsake him.UESo we fasted and begged our God for this: and he was entreated of us.UuThen I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,U and weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:UÉI weighed into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels one hundred talents; of gold one hundred talents;Uiand twenty bowls of gold, of one thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.UôI said to them, You are holy to Yahweh, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh, the God of your fathers.U Watch you, and keep them, until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers' [houses] of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Yahweh.UìSo the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.UœThen we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth [day] of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandit by the way.U1We came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.T  On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest;

yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended loving kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.USNow, our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken your commandments,T  which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness:T  now therefore don't give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.U∂After all that is come on us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that you our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant,U⁄shall we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? would not you be angry with us until you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?U«Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are righteous;

I will not go in.UÇI discerned, and behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.UöFor this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.U•Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.UZSo the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty-two days.UƒIt happened, when all our enemies heard [of it], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God.UqMoreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came to them.UæFor there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife.UqAlso they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.t(NUÖNow it happened, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,Uîthat I put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.T  I said to them, Don't let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand [on guard], let them shut the doors, and bar you them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, and everyone [to be] over against his house.U`Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.U„My God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy.

When the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.t(NU⁄All the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Yahweh had commanded to Israel.UöEzra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.U˚He read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were [attentive] to the book of the law.T5  Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, [and] Meshullam.UáEzra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:U¡and Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God. All the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground.U‹Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people [stood] in their place.UsThey read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.U˘Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to Yahweh your God; don't mourn, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.U◊Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Don't be grieved; for the joy of Yahweh is your strength.UlSo the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be you grieved.U§All the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.UºOn the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers' [houses] of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.UúThey found written in the law, how that Yahweh had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;T  and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mountain, and get olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.UˇSo the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, everyone on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.UÁAll the assembly of those who were come again out of the captivity made booths, and lived in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so. There was very great gladness.UƒAlso day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.t(NUÖNow in the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth on them.UÖThe seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.UµThey stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day; and [another] fourth part they confessed, and worshiped Yahweh their God.U©Then stood up on the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, [and] Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God.T  Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, [and] Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Yahweh your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.UÓYou are Yahweh, even you alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their army, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and you preserve them all; and the army of heaven worships you.UÄYou are Yahweh the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham,T	  and found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous.USYou saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,U¬and showed signs and wonders on Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and did get you a name, as it is this day.U¥You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers you did cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.UãMoreover in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.UëYou came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,Uzand made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant,U’and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commanded those who they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.UgBut they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, and didn't listen to your commandments,T5  and refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn't forsake them.UåYes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt, and had committed awful blasphemies;U˜yet you in your manifold mercies didn't forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud didn't depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.UáYou gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn't withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.UèYes, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, [and] they lacked nothing; their clothes didn't grow old, and their feet didn't swell.UƒMoreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you did allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.UØTheir children also multiplied you as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you did say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.UÛSo the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.T  They took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.UÿNevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies.T  Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.T  But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies,T   and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and didn't listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in them), and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.U«Yet many years did you bear with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.UÖNevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.TX  Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keep covenant and loving kindness, don't let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.UdHowever you are just in all that is come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;U±neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you did testify against them.UƒFor they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and fat land which you gave before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.UêBehold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it.U¬It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.UtYet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;

[One went] on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate;U?and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,U!and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,U0Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,U≤and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;U∑and his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.U¥By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.U≤The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, on the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,Uƒand above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.UsSo stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;Uhand the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;Uöand Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.U«They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.TC  On that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who waited.U∞They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification, and [so did] the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.UxFor in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.T  All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart [that which was] for the Levites; and the Levites set apart [that which was] for the sons of Aaron.t(NU∫On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever,U™because they didn't meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: however our God turned the curse into a blessing.UfIt came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.UzNow before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,T%  had prepared for him a great chamber, where before they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the wave offerings for the priests.U¥But in all this [time] I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,Uëand I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.U`It grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.UöThen I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and there brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal offerings and the frankincense.UúI perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled everyone to his field.UÑThen contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? I gathered them together, and set them in their place.U]Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.T  I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers.UâRemember me, my God, concerning this, and don't wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances.T8  In those days saw I in Judah some men treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys [therewith]; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day in which they sold food.UóThere lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.U~Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day?UöDidn't your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.T)  It came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over the gates, that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day.U]So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.U≤Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge you about the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the Sabbath.UÍI commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness.U[In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:Uèand their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.UÒI contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.U‚Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.UmShall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?UâOne of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.UxRemember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.UyThus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;Ugand for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.ttq(UEsther(NUéNow it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),Unthat in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,UØin the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him.UHe displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days.U¡When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.U‰There were hangings of white, green, and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble.UÅThey gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.U≤In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.UeAlso Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.UÿOn the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,UÖto bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful.UéBut the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him.UÅThen the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for it was the king's custom to consult those who knew law and judgment;U∫and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),UÉ"What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?"UœMemucan answered before the king and the princes, "Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.UﬂFor this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn't come.'UóToday, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's deed will tell all the king's princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.T  If it please the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.U™When the king's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and small."U`This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan:U›for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.t(NUëAfter these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.UbThen the king's servants who served him said, "Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.T  Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women's house, to the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;Uoand let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." The thing pleased the king, and he did so.UäThere was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,U´who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.U⁄He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.U˛So it happened, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.T  The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king's house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women's house.U~Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.UMordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women's house, to find out how Esther did, and what would become of her.T  Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).UêThe young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women's house to the king's house.T   In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women's house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.T&  Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.UãSo Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.UÃThe king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.U∏Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king's bounty.UaWhen the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.U£Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.UΩIn those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.UtThis thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name.UßWhen this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king's presence.t(NUüAfter these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.U∑All the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn't bow down or pay him homage.UuThen the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's commandment?"UºNow it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn't listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.UZWhen Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.UÓBut he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai's people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the Mordecai's people.U‚In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.T%  Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different than other people's. They don't keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not for the king's profit to allow them to remain.U⁄If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries."UnThe king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.UoThe king said to Haman, "The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you."Tõ  Then the king's scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king's ring.T  Letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.UöA copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.UΩThe couriers went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.t(NUµNow when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and wailed loudly and a bitterly.UiHe came even before the king's gate, for no one is allowed inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.UºIn every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.U≤Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn't receive it.UØThen Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.UQSo Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king's gate.U™Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.T  He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.U3Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.UAThen Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:Tp  "All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days."U%They told to Mordecai Esther's words.UèThen Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, "Don't think to yourself that you will escape in the king's house any more than all the Jews.U◊For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. Who knows if you haven't come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"U*Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,T  "Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish."UQSo Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.t(NUÎNow it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, next to the king's house. The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house.U‹When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter.UäThen the king asked her, "What would you like, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom."U{Esther said, "If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him."UôThen the king said, "Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said." So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.UÆThe king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, "What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."UCThen Esther answered and said, "My petition and my request is this.UIf I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said."UªThen Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he didn't stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.UtNevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife.U Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.U∑Haman also said, "Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king.U^Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."T  Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, "Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet." This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.t(NUâOn that night, the king couldn't sleep. He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king.U¶It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.U†The king said, "What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?" Then the king's servants who attended him said, "Nothing has been done for him."UªThe king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.UgThe king's servants said to him, "Behold, Haman stands in the court." The king said, "Let him come in."UΩSo Haman came in. The king said to him, "What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?" Now Haman said in his heart, "Who would the king delight to honor more than myself?"UEHaman said to the king, "For the man whom the king delights to honor,Uèlet royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a crown royal is set.T=  Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, 'Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!'"U»Then the king said to Haman, "Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken."U Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, "Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!"UlMordecai came back to the king's gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered.T  Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him."UÇWhile they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.t(NU<So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.U‘The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, "What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."U≠Then Esther the queen answered, "If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.UÍFor we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondservants and bondmaids, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's loss."UsThen King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, "Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?"UvEsther said, "An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!" Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.UŸThe king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.T!  Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, "Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?" As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.UÊThen Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, "Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman's house." The king said, "Hang him on it!"UjSo they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.t(NU°On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, to Esther the queen. Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.UÄThe king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.U¿Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.U`Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.T5  She said, "If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.U|For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?"U¬Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, "See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews.U◊Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may not be reversed by any man."Tœ  Then the king's scribes were called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language.UØHe wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds.T)  In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,Uwon one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.U¿A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.UñSo the couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.U«Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad.U-The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor.UÒIn every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day. Many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen on them.t(NT?  Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them),UÏthe Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them. No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.U•All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king's business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.UéFor Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.UïThe Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.UGIn the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.U+They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,UPoratha, Adalia, Aridatha,U(Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,Ulthe ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy, but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.UcOn that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.T2  The king said to Esther the queen, "The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done."U√Then Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows."UhThe king commanded this to be done. A decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.UΩThe Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Shushan; but they didn't lay their hand on the spoil.UÈThe other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.UñThis was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.UœBut the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.UœTherefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another.UÖMordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,U`to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly,T  as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy.URThe Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them;U≈because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast "Pur," that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;U◊but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.U Therefore they called these days "Purim," from the word "Pur." Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,T
  the Jews established, and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to its appointed time, every year;UÌand that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memory of them perish from their seed.UÜThen Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.UÇHe sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,U⁄to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.U[The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.t(NUIKing Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands of the sea.U“All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?UƒFor Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his descendants.ttq(UJob(NUçThere was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.U6There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.U›His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.UòHis sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.T5  It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts." Job did so continually.UyNow it happened on the day when the God's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan also came among them.U•Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."U≤Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil."UEThen Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing?UπHaven't you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.U_But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face."UùYahweh said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don't put forth your hand." So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.UoIt fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,Ujthat there came a messenger to Job, and said, "The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,Uìand the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."U—While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said, "The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."U¯While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, "The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."UúWhile he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,U∂and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you."UcThen Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.UóHe said, "Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be the name of Yahweh."U=In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.t(NUúAgain it happened on the day when the God's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.U†Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."T  Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause."UcSatan answered Yahweh, and said, "Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.UfBut put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face."UHYahweh said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life."UySo Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.URHe took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.UYThen his wife said to him, "Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die."U¡But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" In all this Job didn't sin with his lips.T
  Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.UºWhen they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn't recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.UéSo they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.t(NUAAfter this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.UJob answered:UZ"Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, 'There is a boy conceived.'UbLet that day be darkness.

I planted myself vineyards.USI made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit.URI made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest where trees were reared.U´I bought male servants and female servants, and had servants born in my house.

Just that which has been done long ago.UEThen I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.U|The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness--and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.U£Then said I in my heart, "As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?" Then said I in my heart that this also is vanity.UªFor of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten.

Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.t(NUùGuard your steps when you go to God's house; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they don't know that they do evil.UßDon't be rash with your mouth, and don't let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and you on earth. Therefore let your words be few.U]For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool's speech with a multitude of words.UjWhen you vow a vow to God, don't defer to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you vow.UKIt is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.U≥Don't allow your mouth to lead you into sin. Don't protest before the messenger that this was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?UcFor in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well as in many words: but you must fear God.U◊If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a district, don't marvel at the matter: for one official is eyed by a higher one; and there are officials over them.UMMoreover the profit of the earth is for all. The king profits from the field.UwHe who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.UáWhen goods increase, those who eat them are increased; and what advantage is there to its owner, except to feast on them with his eyes?UÄThe sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.U_There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.U^Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand.UóAs he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.UÇThis also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who labors for the wind?UTAll his days he also eats in darkness, he is frustrated, and has sickness and wrath.UÂBehold, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; for this is his portion.U¨Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor--this is the gift of God.UkFor he shall not often reflect on the days of his life; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.t(NUIThere is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy on men:U⁄a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God gives him no power to eat of it, but an alien eats it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.UÿIf a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say, that a stillborn child is better than he:UWfor it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.USMoreover it has not seen the sun nor known it. This has rest rather than the other.UhYes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails to enjoy good, don't all go to one place?UJAll the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.UtFor what advantage has the wise more than the fool?

For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?t(NUaA good name is better than fine perfume; and the day of death better than the day of one's birth.UöIt is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men, and the living should take this to heart.UVSorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good.UcThe heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.UVIt is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.U`For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool.

For you do not ask wisely about this.UYWisdom is as good as an inheritance. Yes, it is more excellent for those who see the sun.UâFor wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.UTConsider the work of God, for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?UºIn the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yes, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything after him.U°All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing.U^Don't be overly righteous, neither make yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?UMDon't be too wicked, neither be foolish. Why should you die before your time?UèIt is good that you should take hold of this. Yes, also from that don't withdraw your hand; for he who fears God will come forth from them all.ULWisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.ULSurely there is not a righteous man on earth, who does good and doesn't sin.UXAlso don't take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you;UMfor often your own heart knows that you yourself have likewise cursed others.USAll this have I proved in wisdom. I said, "I will be wise;" but it was far from me.UDThat which is, is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out?U∑I turned around, and my heart sought to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know that wickedness is stupidity, and that foolishness is madness.U≥I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and traps, whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner will be ensnared by her.UUBehold, this have I found, says the Preacher, one to another, to find out the scheme;UÖwhich my soul still seeks; but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.U\Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they search for many schemes.t(NUîWho is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.U=I say, "Keep the king's command!" because of the oath to God.UkDon't be hasty to go out of his presence. Don't persist in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him,UIfor the king's word is supreme. Who can say to him, "What are you doing?"UjWhoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm, and his wise heart will know the time and procedure.U`For there is a time and procedure for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy on him.ULFor he doesn't know that which will be; for who can tell him how it will be?UÃThere is no man who has power over the spirit to contain the spirit; neither does he have power over the day of death. There is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver those who practice it.UòAll this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt.UìSo I saw the wicked buried. Indeed they came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this. This also is vanity.UáBecause sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.UûThough a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him.UtBut it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow; because he doesn't fear God.U˙There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked. Again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.UﬁThen I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.U¢When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes),U˘then I saw all the work of God, that man can't find out the work that is done under the sun, because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won't find it. Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, he won't be able to find it.t(NUÃFor all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn't know it; all is before them.T	  All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean, to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn't sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath, as he who fears an oath.U›This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.UhFor to him who is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.UñFor the living know that they will die, but the dead don't know anything, neither do they have any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.UôAlso their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.UvGo your way--eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.UDLet your garments be always white, and don't let your head lack oil.U„Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your life of vanity, which he has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity: for that is your portion in life, and in your labor in which you labor under the sun.UíWhatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, where you are going.UÒI returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.U—For man also doesn't know his time. As the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.UMI have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it seemed great to me.UÉThere was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.UwNow a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.UyThen said I, Wisdom is better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.UZThe words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him who rules among fools.UHWisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good.t(NUvDead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.UHA wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart at his left.UqYes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.UtIf the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don't leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.UbThere is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.U?Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.UOI have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.U_He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.U`Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby.UpIf the axe is blunt, and one doesn't sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.UZIf the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer's tongue.UVThe words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.UgThe beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.UpA fool also multiplies words. Man doesn't know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?UXThe labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn't know how to go to the city.UQWoe to you, land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!UÑHappy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!UUBy slothfulness the roof sinks in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.UcA feast is made for laughter, and wine makes the life glad; and money is the answer for all things.U∂Don't curse the king, no, not in your thoughts; and don't curse the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the sky may carry your voice, and that which has wings may tell the matter.t(NUECast your bread on the waters; for you shall find it after many days.U_Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight; for you don't know what evil will be on the earth.U¥If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth; and if a tree falls toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there shall it be.UMHe who observes the wind won't sow; and he who regards the clouds won't reap.U†As you don't know what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child; even so you don't know the work of God who does all.U≤In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening don't withhold your hand; for you don't know which will prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both will be equally good.UQTruly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun.UôYes, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many.

All is vanity!UãFurther, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.UiThe Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.UèThe words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.UuFurthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.UzThis is the end of the matter.

the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy [its fruit].UÖFor there shall be a day, that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise you, and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.UÆFor thus says Yahweh, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish you, praise you, and say, Yahweh, save your people, the remnant of Israel.U˜Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, [and] with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her who travails with child together: a great company shall they return here.UﬁThey shall come with weeping; and with petitions will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.U©Hear the word of Yahweh, you nations, and declare it in the islands afar off; and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as shepherd does his flock.U^For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.T  They shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow to the goodness of Yahweh, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.UºThen shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.UtI will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says Yahweh.U∂Thus says Yahweh: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.U∞Thus says Yahweh: Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says Yahweh; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.UiThere is hope for your latter end, says Yahweh; and [your] children shall come again to their own border.U∆I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus], You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed [to the yoke]: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are Yahweh my God.U¥Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I struck on my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.U«Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him, says Yahweh.U•Set up road signs, make guideposts; set your heart toward the highway, even the way by which you went: turn again, virgin of Israel, turn again to these your cities.UéHow long will you go here and there, you backsliding daughter? for Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.UÍThus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I shall bring again their captivity: Yahweh bless you, habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.UgJudah and all its cities shall dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.UPFor I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.U:On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.UëBehold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of animal.U¬It shall happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, says Yahweh.UsIn those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.UpBut everyone shall die for his own iniquity: every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.UzBehold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:UŸnot according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was a husband to them, says Yahweh.U‰But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Yahweh: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:T  and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Yahweh; for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Yahweh: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.U…Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar; Yahweh of Armies is his name:UáIf these ordinances depart from before me, says Yahweh, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever.UƒThus says Yahweh: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says Yahweh.UBehold, the days come, says Yahweh, that the city shall be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.UhThe measuring line shall go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.UÂThe whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to Yahweh; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever.t(NUàThe word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.U¨Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.UΩFor Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;U€and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes;Uôand he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, says Yahweh: though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper?U5Jeremiah said, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,UûBehold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.TA  So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Yahweh, and said to me, Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of Yahweh.UI bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.UfI subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.U}So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;T
  and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.U'I commanded Baruch before them, saying,UÕThus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.UzFor thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.UkNow after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying,UîAh Lord Yahweh! behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for you,U∑who show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Yahweh of Armies is his name;UØgreat in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:Uíwho performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among [other] men; and made you a name, as in this day;U®and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;Uoand gave them this land, which you did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;U÷and they came in, and possessed it, but they didn't obey your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come on them.T  Behold, the mounds, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what you have spoken has happened; and behold, you see it.UåYou have said to me, Lord Yahweh, Buy you the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.U1Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,UMBehold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?U§Therefore thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:UÎand the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.U⁄For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.U•For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,U˘because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.U¢They have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.UVBut they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.T  They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] to Molech; which I didn't command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.U∆Now therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning this city, about which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:U◊Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation;

and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.UáYes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.UêFor thus says Yahweh: Like as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them.UåFields shall be bought in this land, about which you say, It is desolate, without man or animal; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.TU  Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, says Yahweh.t(NUyMoreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,UVThus says Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it; Yahweh is his name:UgCall to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great things, and difficult, which you don't know.U—For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down [to make a defense] against the mounds and against the sword;UÀwhile [men] come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:UvBehold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them;

For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, says Yahweh.U∆Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.T  In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them, says Yahweh.UúBehold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.UòIn those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.UîIn those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is [the name] by which she shall be called: Yahweh our righteousness.U_For thus says Yahweh: David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;Uëneither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.U,The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,UíThus says Yahweh: If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;Uüthen may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne;

and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so shall they make a burning for you; and they shall lament you, [saying], Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, says Yahweh.UWThen Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,U‡when the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these [alone] remained of the cities of Judah [as] fortified cities.U§The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;U¬that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondservants of them, [to wit], of a Jew his brother.UıAll the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant, go free, that none should make bondservants of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:U≠but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.UBTherefore the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,U¨Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,UÔAt the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers didn't listen to me, neither inclined their ear.U¬You were now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:UÏbut you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.TA  Therefore thus says Yahweh: you have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim to you a liberty, says Yahweh, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine;

and I said to them, Drink you wine.U§But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons, forever:U∏neither shall you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents; that you may live many days in the land in which you sojourn.U©We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;UVnor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:Ulbut we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.U‰But it happened, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians;

So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them.UYThey said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.U†Now it happened, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.UWThey asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?UuThen Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.UcThen said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.U§They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.U So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king.UzNow the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month: and [there was a fire in] the brazier burning before him.U€It happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that [the king] cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.UsThey were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words.UãMoreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not hear them.UµThe king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them.UóThen the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,UåTake again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.T  Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, Thus says Yahweh: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and animal?UÀTherefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.UÂI will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn't listen.T
  Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides to them many like words.t(NUóZedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.UàBut neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did listen to the words of Yahweh, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.UßZedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.UYNow Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.UëPharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem.U=Then came the word of Yahweh to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,UœThus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.UkThe Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.UyThus says Yahweh, Don't deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.UÀFor though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yes would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.UiIt happened that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,UÑthen Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people.U·When he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans.U¶Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he didn't listen to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.UìThe princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.UmWhen Jeremiah was come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;UËThen Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Yahweh? Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.UùMoreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?UÅWhere now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?U≠Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.U˙Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.t(NUøShephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,U⁄Thus says Yahweh, He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey, and he shall live.UyThus says Yahweh, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.T  Then the princes said to the king, Let this man, we pray you, be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man doesn't seek the welfare of this people, but the hurt.UkZedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he who can do anything against you.UÍThen took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king's son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.U™Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),UMEbedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,UıMy lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.U£Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.U¿So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.UâEbedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armholes under the cords. Jeremiah did so.U}So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.U√Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me.UíThen Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.UƒSo Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.U˙Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel: If you will go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your house.U But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.UôZedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.U™But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the voice of Yahweh, in that which I speak to you: so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.UIBut if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me:T  behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on, and have prevailed over you: [now that] your feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.U‡They shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.UVThen said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.U„But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don't hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you:Uéthen you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.U∆Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.USSo Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.t(NU¿It happened when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;Urin the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city),Uﬁthat all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, [to wit], Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.U˜It happened that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.UÚBut the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him.UàThen the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah.UWMoreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.UvThe Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.U‘Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the residue of the people who remained.U§But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.UnNow Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying,U\Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall tell you.UòSo Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;UΩthey sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he lived among the people.U`Now the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,UﬂGo, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before you in that day.U|But I will deliver you in that day, says Yahweh; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.UûFor I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be for a prey to you; because you have put your trust in me, says Yahweh.t(NU¸The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon.UlThe captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;U¶and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke: because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come on you.T<  Now, behold, I loose you this day from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don't: behold, all the land is before you; where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.TN  Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, [said he], to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.UzThen went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.T?  Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;T   then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, [to wit], Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.UŒGedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Don't be afraid to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.UﬁAs for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us: but you, gather you wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.T  Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;U™then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.UzMoreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,U∑and said to him, Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?

and her whole land shall be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.UõThen the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come to her from the north, says Yahweh.UfAs Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.U|You who have escaped the sword, go you, don't stand still;

Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.U|Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.U[Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words,U§and say, Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor animal, but that it shall be desolate forever.UåIt shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:UØand you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; and they shall be weary.

Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.UˆIt happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.U?So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.UãIn the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.T  Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city all around;) and they went toward the Arabah.UéBut the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.UÄThen they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him.UsThe king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.UúHe put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.UﬁNow in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:UÜand he burned the house of Yahweh, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned he with fire.UxAll the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.UÒThen Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.UlBut Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.U The pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.UöThe pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, took they away.U‹The cups, and the fire pans, and the basins, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the bowls--that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,--the captain of the guard took away.UºThe two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh. The brass of all these vessels was without weight.U§As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and its thickness was four fingers: it was hollow.U‘A capital of brass was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates.UqThere were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around.UÄThe captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:T5  and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.UbNebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.UäThe king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.UrThis is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand twenty-three Jews;Uqin the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;UÕin the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.T5  It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the [first] year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison;Ujand he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,Uhand changed his prison garments.

then declare to them their abominations.U‡For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through [the fire] to them to be devoured.UrMoreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.U≠For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house.UºFurthermore you have sent for men who come from far, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you did wash yourself, paint your eyes, and deck yourself with ornaments,Ugand sit on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you did set my incense and my oil.U⁄The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on the hands of them [twain], and beautiful crowns on their heads.UnThen said I of her who was old in adulteries, Now will they play the prostitute with her, and she [with them].UnThey went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute: so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.U≤Righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.UÅFor thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed.U¢The company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.UpThus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.UÑThey shall recompense your lewdness on you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols; and you shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh.t(NUuAgain, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,U~Son of man, write you the name of the day, [even] of this same day: the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day.UéUtter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:Umgather its pieces into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.UòTake the choice of the flock, and also a pile [of wood] for the bones under [the caldron]; make it boil well; yes, let its bones be boiled in its midst.U¬Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen on it.U{For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it on the bare rock; she didn't pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.U{That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood on the bare rock, that it should not be covered.U]Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Woe to the bloody city!

So they came in and stood before the king.U[The king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.UïThen spoke the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live forever: tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.U¡The king answered the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you don't make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.U†But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.UvThey answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.UmThe king answered, I know of a certainty that you would gain time, because you see the thing is gone from me.U˛But if you don't make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation.U’The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man on the earth who can show the king's matter, because no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.UîIt is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.UiFor this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.UsSo the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.UîThen Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon;U}he answered Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so urgent from the king?

Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.U[Daniel answered, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.UñHe changes the times and the seasons; he removes kings, and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding;Ughe reveals the deep and secret things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.UæI thank you, and praise you, you God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known to me what we desired of you; for you have made known to us the king's matter.UıTherefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him: Don't destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.UøThen Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.UåThe king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?U°Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show to the king;U≈but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:U¶as for you, O king, your thoughts came [into your mind] on your bed, what should happen hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen.U‹But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.UúYou, O king, saw, and behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and its aspect was awesome.UsAs for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,U:its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.UâYou saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.T4  Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.UGThis is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king.U|You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;U∏and wherever the children of men dwell, the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand, and has made you to rule over them all: you are the head of gold.UÑAfter you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.U©The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.UœWhereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.UvAs the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.U≤Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cling to one another, even as iron does not mingle with clay.UÒIn the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people;

the great God has made known to the king what shall happen hereafter: and the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.UçThen the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him.U±The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you have been able to reveal this secret.U≥Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.U§Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.t(NU®Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and its breadth six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.T  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.T0  Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up;

these men, O king, have not regarded you: they don't serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.UãThen Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.UüNebuchadnezzar answered them, Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don't serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?TT  Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, [well]: but if you don't worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?UpShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.UãIf it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.U}But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.UËThen was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: [therefore] he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.UêHe commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.U°Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.UßTherefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.UnThese three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.U»Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spoke and said to his counselors, Didn't we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?

So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.UVThese great animals, which are four, are four kings, who shall arise out of the earth.UrBut the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.UÚThen I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was diverse from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;U„and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.UNI saw, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;Uèuntil the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.UƒThus he said, The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.U∞As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.U›He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.UnBut the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.U‰The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole sky, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.UëHere is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my face was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.t(NUåIn the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.U™I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.U√Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.U÷I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no animals could stand before him, neither was there any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.U∞As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn't touch the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.UzHe came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power.T$  I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him; and there was none who could deliver the ram out of his hand.U∂The male goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of the sky.UèOut of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land].UÉIt grew great, even to the army of the sky; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled on them.U°Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual [burnt offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.U±The army was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt offering] through disobedience; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered.T  Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, How long shall be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt offering], and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot?UoHe said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.UñIt happened, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.UI heard a man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.U±So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.UNow as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.UãHe said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.UVThe ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.UiThe rough male goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.UáAs for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.UöIn the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.UπHis power shall be mighty, but not by his own power;

for we have sinned against him.U≈He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us a great evil; for under the whole sky has not been done as has been done on Jerusalem.U∆As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come on us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Yahweh our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in your truth.U£Therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil, and brought it on us; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice.U¥Now, Lord our God, who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gotten you renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.T  Lord, according to all your righteousness, let your anger and please let your wrath be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people are become a reproach to all who are around us.U©Now therefore, our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and to his petitions, and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.U‹My God, turn your ear, and hear;

When he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, "Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me."U¢Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. When I go forth, behold, the prince of Greece shall come.UëBut I will tell you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none who holds with me against these, but Michael your prince."t(NU["As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.UÎNow will I show you the truth.

I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and he comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."UìWhen Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, "Most certainly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith, not even in Israel.UÖI tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,Uybut the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."U}Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed." His servant was healed in that hour.UUWhen Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with a fever.UGHe touched her hand, and the fever left her.

We are dying!"UàHe said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.U^The men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"U¬When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.UÜBehold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"U=Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.U`The demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs."U£He said to them, "Go!" They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.UãThose who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.UtBehold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.t(NUEHe entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city.U£Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you."UFBehold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man blasphemes."UKJesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?UUFor which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Get up, and walk?'UÆBut that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." (then he said to the paralytic), "Get up, and take up your mat, and go up to your house."U#He arose and departed to his house.UeBut when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.UôAs Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, "Follow me." He got up and followed him.U{It happened as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.UsWhen the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"UuWhen Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.UåBut you go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."UsThen John's disciples came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?"U«Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.UÇNo one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.U≈Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined.

Your faith has made you well." And the woman was made well from that hour.UcWhen Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,Ubhe said to them, "Make room, because the girl isn't dead, but sleeping." They were ridiculing him.UXBut when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.U/The report of this went out into all that land.UtAs Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, "Have mercy on us, son of David!"UóWhen he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They told him, "Yes, Lord."UPThen he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it done to you."UbTheir eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, "See that no one knows about this."U>But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.UPAs they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him.UÉWhen the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"UKBut the Pharisees said, "By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons."U∫Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.UèBut when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.UZThen he said to his disciples, "The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few.UUPray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest."t(NUòHe called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.UòNow the names of the twelve apostles are these.

This is what was sown by the roadside.UgWhat was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;Uãyet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.U£What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.UƒWhat was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."UrHe set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,Ubbut while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat, and went away.UZBut when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.UÖThe servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?'Uo"He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?'Uf"But he said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.UÀLet both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, "First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn."'"UçHe set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;U≠which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."UöHe spoke another parable to them. "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened."UkJesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn't speak to them,U™that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,  "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world."UûThen Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field."U?He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,Uàthe field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one.UeThe enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.UiAs therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age.UåThe Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,U]and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.UwThen the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.U•"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.UR"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,U[who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.Ur"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,Uàwhich, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.UtSo will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,Uband will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth."U[Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered him, "Yes, Lord."U∑He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things."UPIt happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.U§Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?UoIsn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?UTAren't all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?"UÖThey were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house."U?He didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.t(NUCAt that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,Uwand said to his servants, "This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him."UzFor Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.U=For John said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."UdWhen he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.U]But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.UGWhereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.UcShe, being prompted by her mother, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer."U}The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,U,and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.UaHis head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother.USHis disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.U†Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.U_Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick.U»When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, "This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food."UUBut Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat."U<They told him, "We only have here five loaves and two fish."U!He said, "Bring them here to me."UﬂHe commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.UxThey all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.UGThose who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.UÑImmediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.UÇAfter he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.UbBut the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.UIIn the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.UwWhen the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It's a ghost!" and they cried out for fear.UQBut immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying "Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid."U[Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters."U]He said, "Come!" Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.UvBut when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"UvImmediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"U0When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.UZThose who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, "You are truly the Son of God!"U@When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.UWhen the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick,Upand they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole.t(NU@Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,Uq"Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread."U\He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?UFor God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'UäBut you say, 'Whoever may tell his father or his mother, "Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,"Unhe shall not honor his father or mother.' You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.U8You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,Um'These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.UIAnd in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules made by men.'"UCHe summoned the multitude, and said to them, "Hear, and understand.UyThat which enters into the mouth doesn't defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."UvThen the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"UUBut he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't plant will be uprooted.UoLeave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."U0Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us."U1So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand?UgDon't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?U]But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.UzFor out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.UbThese are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn't defile the man."UJJesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.UòBehold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!"UsBut he answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away; for she cries after us."UUBut he answered, "I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel."U8But she came and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, help me."U_But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."UaBut she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."UàThen Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour.UkJesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.UíGreat multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,Uîso that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing--and they glorified the God of Israel.U⁄Jesus summoned his disciples and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way."UwThe disciples said to him, "Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?"U\Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."U5He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;Uâand he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.UhThey all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.UAThose who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.UZThen he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.t(NU]The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.UbBut he answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'U¡In the morning, 'It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.' Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can't discern the signs of the times!UüAn evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah." He left them, and departed.UEThe disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread.UWJesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."U>They reasoned among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."UzJesus, perceiving it, said, "Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, 'because you have brought no bread?'UqDon't you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?UMNor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?UáHow is it that you don't perceive that I didn't speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."UÇThen they understood that he didn't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.UÖNow when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?"UdThey said, "Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."U0He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"UFSimon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."UàJesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.UÇI also tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.U∫I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven."UYThen he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he is Jesus the Christ.U¡From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.UrPeter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you."U¨But he turned, and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."UÇThen Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.UkFor whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.UÑFor what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?UÑFor the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds.UêMost certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom."t(NUAfter six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.UlHe was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light.U;Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.U¢Peter answered, and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let's make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."UπWhile he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."ULWhen the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.UDJesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, and don't be afraid."U;Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.UôAs they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Don't tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."U[His disciples asked him, saying, "Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"UMJesus answered them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,U•but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn't recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them."UIThen the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.UQWhen they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying,UÖ"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.UASo I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him."UÜJesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me."USJesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.U[Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, "Why weren't we able to cast it out?"UÍHe said to them, "Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.U;But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting."UzWhile they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,U]and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up." They were exceedingly sorry.UãWhen they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter, and said, "Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma?"UÃHe said, "Yes." When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?"U[Peter said to him, "From strangers." Jesus said to him, "Therefore the children are exempt.U÷But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and you."t(NUbIn that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"UIJesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the midst of them,Uäand said, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.UjWhoever therefore humbles himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.U>Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,Uœbut whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea.Uî"Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!UŸIf your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.UΩIf your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.UíSee that you don't despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.U4For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.U¨"What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn't he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?UyIf he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.UgEven so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.Uç"If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother.UÉBut if he doesn't listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.UïIf he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.U®Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.U£Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.UZFor where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them."UyThen Peter came and said to him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?"UWJesus said to him, "I don't tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.UkTherefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.UYWhen he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.UâBut because he couldn't pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.UxThe servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, 'Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!'U^The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.U≤"But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'Us"So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you!'U]He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.U~So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.UvThen his lord called him in, and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.UVShouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?'UeHis lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.UuSo my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don't each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds."t(NUÄIt happened when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.U8Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.UlPharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"UbHe answered, "Haven't you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,UÉand said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?'UoSo that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don't let man tear apart."U_They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?"UéHe said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.UÆI tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery."UhHis disciples said to him, "If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry."UYBut he said to them, "Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.T  For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it."UxThen little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.UáBut Jesus said, "Allow the little children, and don't forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these."U3He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.UkBehold, one came to him and said, "Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"UãHe said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."U°He said to him, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false testimony.'UQ'Honor your father and mother.' And, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"UbThe young man said to him, "All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?"UòJesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."UdBut when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions.U|Jesus said to his disciples, "Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.UAgain I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."U_When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"UaLooking at them, Jesus said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."UaThen Peter answered, "Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?"U‰Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.UøEveryone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.U<But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.t(NUê"For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.UZWhen he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.URHe went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.UpTo them he said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.'

Who gave you this authority?"UãJesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.U∑The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?" They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'URBut if we say, 'From men,' we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet."UÉThey answered Jesus, and said, "We don't know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.UsBut what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'UGHe answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind, and went.U[He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, 'I go, sir,' but he didn't go.UÿWhich of the two did the will of his father?" They said to him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God before you.U’For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn't believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn't even repent afterward, that you might believe him.U‘"Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.UcWhen the season for the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.ULThe farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.UVAgain, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way.UJBut afterward he sent to them his son, saying, 'They will respect my son.'UÉBut the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and seize his inheritance.'UDSo they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.UQWhen therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?"UúThey told him, "He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season."U¬Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner. This was from the Lord. It is marvelous in our eyes?'U~"Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit.UoHe who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whoever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust."UeWhen the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.UgWhen they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet.t(NU;Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,UU"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,Uhand sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come.U Again he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "Behold, I have made ready my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!"'U`But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,UPand the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.UnWhen the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.U`"Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren't worthy.UnGo therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.'UéThose servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.UdBut when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn't have on wedding clothing,Ugand he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?' He was speechless.U≠Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.'U%For many are called, but few chosen."UOThen the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.U»They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter who you teach, for you aren't partial to anyone.USTell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"UTBut Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?U7Show me the tax money." They brought to him a denarius.U5He asked them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"UíThey said to him, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."U?When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away.U`On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,Uásaying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.'UsNow there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.U>In like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.UAfter them all, the woman died.UZIn the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her."U]But Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.UkFor in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God's angels in heaven.UjBut concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,Uz'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?' God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."UCWhen the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.UdBut the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.U9One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.U8"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"UwJesus said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'U(This is the first and great commandment.UFA second likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'UAThe whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."ULNow while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,UYsaying, "What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "Of David."UJHe said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,Uf'The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'U2"If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"UnNo one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth.t(NU8Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,U:saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses' seat.U}All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but don't do their works; for they say, and don't do.UîFor they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them.UyBut all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad, enlarge the fringes of their garments,UHand love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,ULthe salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi, Rabbi' by men.UbBut don't you be called 'Rabbi,' for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers.URCall no man on the earth your father, for one is your Father, he who is in heaven.U>Neither be called masters, for one is your master, the Christ.U6But he who is greatest among you will be your servant.UTWhoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.U®"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!

He went away and hanged himself.UáThe chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, "It's not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood."UQThey took counsel, and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.UATherefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this day.U”Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him upon whom a price had been set, whom some of the children of Israel priced,UEand they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."UâNow Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "So you say."UIWhen he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.USThen Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how many things they testify against you?"UPHe gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.UiNow at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.U2They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.UìWhen therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?"U;For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.U∫While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."UeNow the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.UkBut the governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas!"UyPilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?" They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"UtBut the governor said, "Why? What evil has he done?" But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let him be crucified!"UÂSo when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it."UGAll the people answered, "May his blood be on us, and on our children!"UVThen he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.UrThen the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.U1They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.U®They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"U?They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.UuWhen they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.UÉAs they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.UOThey came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say, "The place of a skull."U\They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.UPWhen they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,U#and they sat and watched him there.UdThey set up over his head the accusation against him written, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."UZThen there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.U8Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,Uâand saying, "You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"U_Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,Uã"He saved others, but he can't save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.U`He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"UKThe robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.URNow from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.UéAbout the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"UUSome of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This man is calling Elijah."UwImmediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.UHThe rest said, "Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him."U?Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.UuBehold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.UWThe tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;Uiand coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.U∏Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."U[Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.UjAmong them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.UkWhen evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus' disciple came.UbThis man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.U<Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,UÖand laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.UHMary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.UáNow on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,Uqsaying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: 'After three days I will rise again.'UËCommand therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead;' and the last deception will be worse than the first."UJPilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can."UHSo they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.t(NUÄNow after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.UóBehold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.UBHis appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.U<For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.UgThe angel answered the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.UbHe is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.UüGo quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."UaThey departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.UÜAs they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.U}Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."UÜNow while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.UtWhen they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,UQsaying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.UWIf this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."U}So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.UVBut the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.U<When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.UiJesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.UÄTherefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,Uzteaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen.ttq)(UMark(NU?The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.UvAs it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.UfThe voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight!'"UfJohn came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.UäAll the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.UfJohn was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.UÑHe preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.UEI baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."UlIt happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.UoImmediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.UQA voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."U9Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.UzHe was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.UnNow after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God,Umand saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News."UÜPassing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.UNJesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men."U3Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.UâGoing on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.UyImmediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.UfThey went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.UeThey were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.UXImmediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,Uåsaying, "Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!"U;Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"UQThe unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.U≥They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!"UjThe report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.UxImmediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.UYNow Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.U]He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.UpAt evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons.U/All the city was gathered together at the door.UâHe healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn't allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.U}Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there.U5Simon and those who were with him followed after him;U@and they found him, and told him, "Everyone is looking for you."U|He said to them, "Let's go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason."UWHe went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.UsA leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."UuBeing moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made clean."UXWhen he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.U5He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,UÆand said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."UÕBut he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.t(NU\When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.UÅImmediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them.U.Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him.U™When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on.UTJesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you."UPBut there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,UT"Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"UíImmediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason these things in your hearts?UuWhich is easier, to tell the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?'UmBut that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the paralytic--U<"I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house."U©He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"UTHe went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them.UçAs he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he arose and followed him.U¥It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.U¿The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"U∞When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."UØJohn's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?"UéJesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast.UmBut the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.UëNo one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.UπNo one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins."UçIt happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.U`The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"UwHe said to them, "Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry--he, and those who were with him?UπHow he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?"UHHe said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.U6Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."t(NUYHe entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.U[They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.U9He said to the man who had his hand withered, "Stand up."UHe said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?" But they were silent.U“When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.UmThe Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.UjJesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,Uòfrom Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.U{He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn't press on him.UaFor he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.UfThe unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, "You are the Son of God!"U;He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.U_He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.U\He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,U@and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:U&Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;UsJames the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder;UfAndrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;U@and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. He came into a house.UOThe multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.UUWhen his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, "He is insane."U~The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul," and, "By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons."UNHe summoned them, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?UBIf a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.U>If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.UVIf Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end.UãBut no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.UäMost certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;Uibut whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"U0--because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."UVHis mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.UäA multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, "Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you."U6He answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"UXLooking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!UUFor whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."t(NU∂Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.UFHe taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,U,"Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,U]and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.UyOthers fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.UVWhen the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.U]Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.UßOthers fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much."U2He said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."UZWhen he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.UÉHe said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,U™that 'seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.'"UaHe said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?UThe farmer sows the word.U°The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.UÖThese in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.UäThey have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.UXOthers are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,Uêand the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.U¶Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times."UgHe said to them, "Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn't it put on a stand?UÖFor there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.U+If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."UëHe said to them, "Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.UyFor whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him."UJHe said, "The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,Ueand should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't know how.UYFor the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.U`But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."U[He said, "How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?UÉIt's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,Uùyet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow."UPWith many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.UfWithout a parable he didn't speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.UWOn that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let's go over to the other side."UrLeaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.UcA big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.UÑHe himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, "Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?"UtHe awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.UKHe said to them, "Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?"UoThey were greatly afraid, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"t(NUJThey came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.UdWhen he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs.ULHe lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,U™because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.UmAlways, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.U:When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,Uîand crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don't torment me."U>For he said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"UXHe asked him, "What is your name?" He said to him, "My name is Legion, for we are many."UGHe begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.U?Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.UXAll the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them."U≈At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.UzThose who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. The people came to see what it was that had happened.UúThey came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.UiThose who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.U2They began to beg him to depart from their region.UkAs he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.U¢He didn't allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you."UsHe went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.U}When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.UfBehold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,Uöand begged him much, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live."U]He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.U<A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,Uzand had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,Uchaving heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.UAFor she said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well."UoImmediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.UèImmediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"UgHis disciples said to him, "You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"U4He looked around to see her who had done this thing.UÉBut the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.UdHe said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease."UãWhile he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler's house saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?"U}But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don't be afraid, only believe."UTHe allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.UYHe came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.UtWhen he had entered in, he said to them, "Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep."U¢They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.UyTaking the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha cumi!" which means, being interpreted, "Girl, I tell you, get up!"UmImmediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.UrHe strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.t(NUUHe went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.U˜When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?UñIsn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" They were offended at him.UÉJesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."UfHe could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them.ULHe marveled because of their unbelief. He went around the villages teaching.U|He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.UÖHe commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,U/but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.UZHe said to them, "Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.T  Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"U5They went out and preached that people should repent.UUThey cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them.UûKing Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him."U]But others said, "He is Elijah." Others said, "He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets."UaBut Herod, when he heard this, said, "This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead."UñFor Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.UOFor John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."ULHerodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn't,Uófor Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.UÖThen a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.UøWhen the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you."U[He swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."UdShe went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" She said, "The head of John the Baptizer."UàShe came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter."UvThe king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn't wish to refuse her.UÖImmediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John's head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,Ukand brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.UWWhen his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.UáThe apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.UöHe said to them, "You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile." For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.U=They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.UäThey saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.UûJesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.UuWhen it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, "This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.UÑSend them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat."U°But he answered them, "You give them something to eat." They asked him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?"UhHe said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go see." When they knew, they said, "Five, and two fish."UMHe commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.U3They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.U¡He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.UThey all ate, and were filled.UGThey took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.U0Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.UèImmediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.UBAfter he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.UZWhen evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.UØSeeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,U\but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;UÑfor they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, "Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid."UnHe got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;ULfor they hadn't understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.UUWhen they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.UJWhen they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,Utand ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.U‡Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.t(NUaThen the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.UnNow when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.UÇ(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.U—They don't eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)UõThe Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?"UòHe answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.UOBut in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'Uö"For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things."UcHe said to them, "Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.U|For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother;' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'UíBut you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;"'UIthen you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,Uimaking void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this."U_He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.UòThere is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.U*If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"UdWhen he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.UåHe said to them, "Are you thus without understanding also? Don't you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can't defile him,Upbecause it doesn't go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus making all foods clean?"UCHe said, "That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.UkFor from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,U_covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.U<All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."U°From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn't want anyone to know it, but he couldn't escape notice.UnFor a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.UuNow the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.UãBut Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."U_But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."UXHe said to her, "For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter."UeShe went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.UÉAgain he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of Decapolis.UqThey brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.UxHe took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.UTLooking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!"UfImmediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.U{He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.U|They were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"t(NUãIn those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to them,Un"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.UnIf I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way."UlHis disciples answered him, "From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?"UAHe asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven."UøHe commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.ULThey had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.U[They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.UEThose who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.U`Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.UgThe Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him.UñHe sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation."UKHe left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.UYThey forgot to take bread; and they didn't have more than one loaf in the boat with them.UaHe warned them, saying, "Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."UHThey reasoned with one another, saying, "It's because we have no bread."U•Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, "Why do you reason that it's because you have no bread? Don't you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?ULHaving eyes, don't you see? Having ears, don't you hear? Don't you remember?UáWhen I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?" They told him, "Twelve."U~"When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?" They told him, "Seven."U+He asked them, "Don't you understand, yet?"USHe came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.U®He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.UGHe looked up, and said, "I see men; for I see them like trees walking."UiThen again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.UfHe sent him away to his house, saying, "Don't enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village."UäJesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, "Who do men say that I am?"U[They told him, "John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets."UVHe said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ."U9He commanded them that they should tell no one about him.U∂He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.UAHe spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.U•But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men."U•He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, "Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.UáFor whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.UMFor what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?U2For what will a man give in exchange for his life?U«For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."t(NUúHe said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power."U≥After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.UlHis clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.UDElijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.UÑPeter answered Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let's make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."U:For he didn't know what to say, for they were very afraid.UmA cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."UOSuddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.U©As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.UWThey kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the "rising from the dead" meant.UMThey asked him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"U†He said to them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?U~But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him."U\Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.UfImmediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him.U1He asked the scribes, "What are you asking them?"UXOne of the multitude answered, "Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;U∞and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren't able."UyHe answered him, "Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me."UíThey brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.UaHe asked his father, "How long has it been since this has come to him?" He said, "From childhood.UçOften it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us."UUJesus said to him, "If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes."UXImmediately the father of the child cried out with tears, "I believe. Help my unbelief!"UªWhen Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, "You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!"UàHaving cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, "He is dead."U@But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.UbWhen he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"USHe said to them, "This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting."UWThey went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He didn't want anyone to know it.U√For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, "The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again."UBBut they didn't understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.UvHe came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, "What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?"UcBut they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest.UÖHe sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, "If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all."UbHe took a little child, and set him in the midst of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,UÉ"Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn't receive me, but him who sent me."UîJohn said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone who doesn't follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn't follow us."UÖBut Jesus said, "Don't forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.U-For whoever is not against us is on our side.UïFor whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christ's, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.U©Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he was thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.U±If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire,U='where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'U√If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that will never be quenched--U='where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'U¥If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire,U='where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'UVFor everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.UèSalt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."t(NU£He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.U_Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"U*He answered, "What did Moses command you?"UVThey said, "Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her."USBut Jesus said to them, "For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.UFBut from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.UQFor this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,UQand the two will become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.U=What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."UBIn the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter.U_He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.UTIf a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery."U}They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.UµBut when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them, "Allow the little children to come to me! Don't forbid them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.U}Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it."UEHe took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them.UìAs he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"ULJesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except one--God.UßYou know the commandments: 'Do not murder,' 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false testimony,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and mother.'"UJHe said to him, "Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth."U»Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, "One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross."UgBut his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.UÅJesus looked around, and said to his disciples, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!"UõThe disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, "Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!UlIt is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."UIThey were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, "Then who can be saved?"UrJesus, looking at them, said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God."UKPeter began to tell him, "Behold, we have left all, and have followed you."U…Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,U¨but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.U9But many who are first will be last; and the last first."UÍThey were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.U≥"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.UaThey will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again."UxJames and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask."U5He said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"UrThey said to him, "Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory."U¶But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"U¶They said to him, "We are able." Jesus said to them, "You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;Uhbut to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared."UIWhen the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards James and John.UÆJesus summoned them, and said to them, "You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.UdBut it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.ULWhoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all.UhFor the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."U•They came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.UxWhen he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, "Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"UlMany rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, "You son of David, have mercy on me!"UyJesus stood still, and said, "Call him." They called the blind man, saying to him, "Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!"U9He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.UrJesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said to him, "Rhabboni, that I may see again."UÅJesus said to him, "Go your way. Your faith has made you well." Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.t(NUrWhen they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,UΩand said to them, "Go your way into the village that is opposite you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him.UuIf anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs him;' and immediately he will send him back here."UjThey went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him.UYSome of those who stood there asked them, "What are you doing, untying the young donkey?"U?They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.U\They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it.U|Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and spreading them on the road.UvThose who went in front, and those who followed, cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!UkBlessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"UíJesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.UAThe next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry.U∂Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.UVJesus told it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!" and his disciples heard it.UﬂThey came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.UBHe would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple.UñHe taught, saying to them, "Isn't it written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?' But you have made it a den of robbers!"U°The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.U+When evening came, he went out of the city.UUAs they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.U`Peter, remembering, said to him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away."U(Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.U–For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and doesn't doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says.U}Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.UöWhenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions.U[But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions."UÇThey came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him,U|and they began saying to him, "By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?"UuJesus said to them, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.UAThe baptism of John--was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me."UyThey reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we should say, 'From heaven;' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'U`If we should say, 'From men'"--they feared the people, for all held John to really be a prophet.UvThey answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."t(NUæHe began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country.UpWhen it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard.U1They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.UÑAgain, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.U\Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.UjTherefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'UtBut those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'U<They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.U|What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.UwHaven't you even read this Scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner.U6This was from the Lord, it is marvelous in our eyes'?"UêThey tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away.UaThey sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.U‘When they had come, they asked him, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don't defer to anyone; for you aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?UíShall we give, or shall we not give?" But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it."UfThey brought it. He said to them, "Whose is this image and inscription?" They said to him, "Caesar's."UâJesus answered them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." They marveled greatly at him.U[There came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,Uº"Teacher, Moses wrote to us, 'If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.'UNThere were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.URThe second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;UMand the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.UfIn the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife."UlJesus answered them, "Isn't this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?UtFor when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.U¡But about the dead, that they are raised; haven't you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?UTHe is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken."UúOne of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is the greatest of all?"USJesus answered, "The greatest is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one:U°you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment.UwThe second is like this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."UkThe scribe said to him, "Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he,Uÿand to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."UêWhen Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God." No one dared ask him any question after that.UqJesus responded, as he taught in the temple, "How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?UîFor David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'UfTherefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?" The common people heard him gladly.UÇIn his teaching he said to them, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,UDand the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts:Upthose who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."U~Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.UVA poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin.UúHe called his disciples to himself, and said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,Uifor they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on."t(NU~As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!"UáJesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down."UiAs he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,Ug"Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?"UOJesus, answering, began to tell them, "Be careful that no one leads you astray.ULFor many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and will lead many astray.Ul"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.U¡For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains.UÆBut watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.U8The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.UÕWhen they lead you away and deliver you up, don't be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.Ué"Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.UgYou will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.U¿But when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,U`and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.U>Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.UPBut woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!U-Pray that your flight won't be in the winter.U¢For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.UóUnless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.UZThen if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there!' don't believe it.UïFor there will arise false christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.U>But you watch. "Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.UeBut in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,U^the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.UNThen they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.UíThen he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky.Uè"Now from the fig tree, learn this parable.

She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.UdBut there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, "Why has this ointment been wasted?UuFor this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." They grumbled against her.UZBut Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.UwFor you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.UQShe has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.U¨Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her."UmJudas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.UuThey, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.U¨On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover?"UâHe sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,Uóand wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'UZHe will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make ready for us there."UxHis disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.U,When it was evening he came with the twelve.UuAs they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me--he who eats with me."UhThey began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, "Surely not I?" And another said, "Surely not I?"ULHe answered them, "It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.U´For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."UÜAs they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body."UUHe took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.UUHe said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.UÖMost certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God."U@When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.U†Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'UBHowever, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."UGBut Peter said to him, "Although all will be offended, yet I will not."UéJesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."UgBut he spoke all the more, "If I must die with you, I will not deny you." They all said the same thing.UdThey came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray."UYHe took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.UYHe said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch."UzHe went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.UâHe said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire."UjHe came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn't you watch one hour?UmWatch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."U6Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.UtAgain he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn't know what to answer him.U´He came the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.U>Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."UÆImmediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.U~Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whoever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely."UWWhen he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, "Rabbi! Rabbi!" and kissed him.U-They laid their hands on him, and seized him.UwBut a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.U`Jesus answered them, "Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?U~I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."UThey all left him, and fled.U}A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,U6but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.UrThey led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him.U®Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.UoNow the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.U\For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn't agree with each other.U<Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,UÑ"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.'"U'Even so, their testimony did not agree.UyThe high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?"UyBut he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"UzJesus said, "I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky."UTThe high priest tore his clothes, and said, "What further need have we of witnesses?U_You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?" They all condemned him to be worthy of death.U°Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!" The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.UNAs Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,Uhand seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!"UÅBut he denied it, saying, "I neither know, nor understand what you are saying." He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.UTThe maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, "This is one of them."U£But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, "You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it."UOBut he began to curse, and to swear, "I don't know this man of whom you speak!"UøThe rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." When he thought about that, he wept.t(NUΩImmediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.ULPilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered, "So you say."U-The chief priests accused him of many things.U[Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!"U:But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.UQNow at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.U|There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.UNThe multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.UVPilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"UFFor he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.U`But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.U[Pilate again asked them, "What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"U$They cried out again, "Crucify him!"UaPilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!"UÑPilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.UoThe soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.UPThey clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.U3They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"U]They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.U|When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.UöThey compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.UcThey brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place of a skull."UGThey offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn't take it.UaCrucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.U.It was the third hour, and they crucified him.URThe superscription of his accusation was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."UPWith him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.UNThe Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was numbered with transgressors."UÅThose who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,U-save yourself, and come down from the cross!"UyLikewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He can't save himself.UìLet the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him." Those who were crucified with him insulted him.UZWhen the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.U°At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"UUSome of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah."U§One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down."U:Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.UBThe veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.UìWhen the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"UéThere were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;Urwho, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.UcWhen evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,U£Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.UqPilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.UDWhen he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.U¥He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.UDMary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.t(NUàWhen the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.UVVery early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.UcThey were saying among themselves, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"UIfor it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.UvEntering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.UùHe said to them, "Don't be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!UtBut go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.'"UäThey went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.UÜNow when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.UHShe went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.UNWhen they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.UqAfter these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.UIThey went away and told it to the rest. They didn't believe them, either.U—Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn't believe those who had seen him after he had risen.UXHe said to them, "Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation.UXHe who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.UwThese signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;Uïthey will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."UxSo then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.U}They went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed.

This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.UqIt had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.UöHe came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,U>then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,UN"Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to your word, in peace;U%for my eyes have seen your salvation,U7which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;ULa light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel."UTJoseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,U´and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, "Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.UbYes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."U•There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,Uêand she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn't depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day.UÖComing up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.UäWhen they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.UvThe child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.UFHis parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.U]When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,Uçand when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn't know it,UÉbut supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.UGWhen they didn't find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.UìIt happened after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.UCAll who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.UßWhen they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you."UdHe said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?"U9They didn't understand the saying which he spoke to them.U}And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.UIAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.t(NUÛNow in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,Utin the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.UiHe came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.U¶As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.UÜEvery valley will be filled. Every mountain and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become straight, and the rough ways smooth.U%All flesh will see God's salvation.'"UêHe said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?U–Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and don't begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father;' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!UïEven now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire."U1The multitudes asked him, "What then must we do?"UqHe answered them, "He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise."UZTax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what must we do?"UGHe said to them, "Collect no more than that which is appointed to you."U≥Soldiers also asked him, saying, "What about us? What must we do?" He said to them, "Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages."U{As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,U«John answered them all, "I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,U≠whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."UFThen with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,UÅbut Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,U<added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.UvNow it happened, when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,Uúand the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying "You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased."U~Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,U]the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,U]the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,U`the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,Ubthe son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,UXthe son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,U[the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,U]the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,U]the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,UZthe son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,U]the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,U[the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,UWthe son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,U\the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,Udthe son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,UBthe son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.t(NUgJesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wildernessU}for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.UWThe devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."UkJesus answered him, saying, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.'"UkThe devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.UèThe devil said to him, "I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.U?If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours."UÇJesus answered him, "Get behind me Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.'"UéHe led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here,UKfor it is written, 'He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;'U^and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.'"UZJesus answering, said to him, "It has been said, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"UWWhen the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time.UsJesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area.U6He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.UéHe came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.UoThe book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,U"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed,U1and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."UwHe closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.URHe began to tell them, "Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."UáAll testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, "Isn't this Joseph's son?"U†He said to them, "Doubtless you will tell me this parable, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.'"UNHe said, "Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.UÆBut truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.UgElijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.UÅThere were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian."UMThey were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things.UìThey rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff.U8But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.UVHe came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,UJand they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.UjIn the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,Uásaying, "Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!"UúJesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!" When the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm.UØAmazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, "What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!"UCNews about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.UìHe rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her.UcHe stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.UúWhen the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.UµDemons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" Rebuking them, he didn't allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.UØWhen it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn't go away from them.UÑBut he said to them, "I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent."U.He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.t(NU~Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.UkHe saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.UöHe entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.UmWhen he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch."UnSimon answered him, "Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net."U[When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.UïThey beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.UrBut Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord."UYFor he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;U¶and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive."URWhen they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.U«It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."UqHe stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean." Immediately the leprosy left him.U≠He commanded him to tell no one, "But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."UâBut the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.U4But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.UÈIt happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.UbBehold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.U¶Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus.UFSeeing their faith, he said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."UÇThe scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"U^But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?URWhich is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?'U≤But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" (he said to the paralyzed man), "I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house."UwImmediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.U|Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."U{After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, "Follow me!"U1He left everything, and rose up and followed him.UÄLevi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.UáTheir scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"UdJesus answered them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.UBI have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."UáThey said to him, "Why do John's disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"UeHe said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?UlBut the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days."U∞He also told a parable to them. "No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.UåNo one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.UFBut new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.UXNo man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, 'The old is better.'"t(NU≤Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.UjBut some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?"UrJesus, answering them, said, "Haven't you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;U™how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?"U9He said to them, "The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."UäIt also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.UáThe scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.UÖBut he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Rise up, and stand in the middle." He arose and stood.UáThen Jesus said to them, "I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?"UÑHe looked around at them all, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.U^But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.UqIt happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.UeWhen it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:UWSimon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;UNMatthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot;UFJudas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor.UÔHe came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;URas well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.UWAll the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all.UqHe lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God.UiBlessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.UéBlessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake.UàRejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.UE"But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.UpWoe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.U\Woe, when men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.UK"But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,U?bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.UÅTo him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don't withhold your coat also.UcGive to everyone who asks you, and don't ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.U>"As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.UfIf you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.UeIf you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.UÜIf you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.UæBut love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.U<Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is also merciful.UtDon't judge, and you won't be judged. Don't condemn, and you won't be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free.U¿"Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you."U\He spoke a parable to them. "Can the blind guide the blind? Won't they both fall into a pit?UdA disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.UuWhy do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?T1  Or how can you tell your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,' when you yourself don't see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite!

For people don't gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.U‡The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.UG"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and don't do the things which I say?U\Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.U—He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.UƒBut he who hears, and doesn't do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great."t(NUWAfter he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.UWA certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.UfWhen he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.UeWhen they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for you to do this for him,U<for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us."U¡Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.UlTherefore I didn't even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.U¬For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers.

Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.U∞Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.UNWhen the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, "Don't cry."UjHe came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I tell you, arise!"UJHe who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.UÄFear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us!" and, "God has visited his people!"U]This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.U6The disciples of John told him about all these things.UäJohn, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?"UèWhen the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?'"UnIn that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.UÒJesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.U)Blessed is he who is not offended by me."UúWhen John's messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?UîBut what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.UYBut what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.UwThis is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'U®"For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he."U~When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John's baptism.UdBut the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.UM"To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?UùThey are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, 'We piped to you, and you didn't dance. We mourned, and you didn't weep.'UaFor John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'UçThe Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'U)Wisdom is justified by all her children."UmOne of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat at the table.UîBehold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.U≤Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.U∆Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner."UVJesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." He said, "Teacher, say on."UZ"A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.UZWhen they couldn't pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?"UjSimon answered, "He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most." He said to him, "You have judged correctly."U“Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.UWYou gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.UOYou didn't anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.UâTherefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."U)He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."UeThose who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"U>He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."t(NU¢It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,Uäand certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;Urand Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod's steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions.UkWhen a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.Uí"The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.UbOther seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.UGOther fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.UßOther fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times." As he said these things, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"U<Then his disciples asked him, "What does this parable mean?"U´He said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'U5Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.UêThose along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.U°Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.U∏That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.UîThat in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.Uó"No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.UpFor nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.U¢Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has."UTHis mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.UcIt was told him by some saying, "Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you."U`But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it."U∑Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they launched out.U{But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.U¶They came to him, and awoke him, saying, "Master, master, we are dying!" He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.U±He said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, "Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"UHThey arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.U¢When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn't live in a house, but in the tombs.UπWhen he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torment me!"UˆFor Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.U^Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.UDThey begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.UìNow there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.UÖThe demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.UeWhen those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.UøPeople went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.UNThose who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.U°All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.UtBut the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,U¨"Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you." He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.UeIt happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.UèBehold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus' feet, and begged him to come into his house,U~for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.U}A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,Udcame behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.UûJesus said, "Who touched me?" When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"UVBut Jesus said, "Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me."U’When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.UPHe said to her, "Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace."UäWhile he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue's house came, saying to him, "Your daughter is dead. Don't trouble the Teacher."U\But Jesus hearing it, answered him, "Don't be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed."UÇWhen he came to the house, he didn't allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.U[All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, "Don't weep. She isn't dead, but sleeping."U4They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.U[But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, "Child, arise!"UeHer spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.UQHer parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.t(NUgHe called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.UFHe sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.UÅHe said to them, "Take nothing for your journey--neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.UAInto whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.UÉAs many as don't receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."UaThey departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.UìNow Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,Uaand by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.UdHerod said, "John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?" He sought to see him.UöThe apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done. He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.UíBut the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing.U‘The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, "Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place."U©But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people."UtFor they were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each."U(They did so, and made them all sit down.U°He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.UdThey ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.UÅIt happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"UxThey answered, "'John the Baptizer,' but others say, 'Elijah,' and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again."UUHe said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."U>But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,Uõsaying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up."UlHe said to all, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.UuFor whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.U^For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?U™For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.UàBut I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God."UÜIt happened about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.UfAs he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.UABehold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,Uawho appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.UîNow Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.U”It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let's make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what he said.UtWhile he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.UOA voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!"UÇWhen the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.UgIt happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him.UpBehold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.UêBehold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.U;I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn't."UyJesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."U´While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.UâThey were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,Ue"Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men."UòBut they didn't understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.UHThere arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.U^Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,U∏and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great."UJohn answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn't follow with us."UNJesus said to him, "Don't forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us."UqIt came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,Uwand sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.UVThey didn't receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.U†When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?"UOBut he turned and rebuked them, "You don't know of what kind of spirit you are.UgFor the Son of Man didn't come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." They went to another village.UaAs they went on the way, a certain man said to him, "I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord."UÄJesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."U^He said to another, "Follow me!" But he said, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."UkBut Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God."UqAnother also said, "I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house."UrBut Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God."t(NUúNow after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place, where he was about to come.U¨Then he said to them, "The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.U;Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.UACarry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way.UCInto whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'U[If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.UäRemain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Don't go from house to house.U[Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.UXHeal the sick who are therein, and tell them, 'The Kingdom of God has come near to you.'U^But into whatever city you enter, and they don't receive you, go out into its streets and say,Uê'Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.'UOI tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.U¿"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.UNBut it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.UIYou, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.UvWhoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."U^The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!"UGHe said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.UáBehold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you.U}Nevertheless, don't rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."T  In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight."U‡Turning to the disciples, he said, "All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him."UeTurning to the disciples, he said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,Ußfor I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them."UmBehold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"UAHe said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"UßHe answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."UJHe said to him, "You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live."UGBut he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"U¨Jesus answered, "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.UdBy chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.UcIn the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.UjBut a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,Uçcame to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.UªOn the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'UaNow which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?"UTHe said, "He who showed mercy on him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."UáIt happened as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.UNShe had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.U™But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, "Lord, don't you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me."UTJesus answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,U_but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her."t(NU¢It happened, that when he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."U£He said to them, "When you pray, say, 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come. May your will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven.U#Give us day by day our daily bread.UîForgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'"UxHe said to them, "Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,UZfor a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,'Uóand he from within will answer and say, 'Don't bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give it to you'?U£I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.UÅ"I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.UXFor everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.Uô"Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won't give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?U@Or if he asks for an egg, he won't give him a scorpion, will he?UöIf you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"UáHe was casting out a demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.UTBut some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."U8Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.UìBut he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.UvIf Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.UrBut if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.UWBut if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.UO"When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.UáBut when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.UN"He that is not with me is against me. He who doesn't gather with me scatters.UÆThe unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, 'I will turn back to my house from which I came out.'U4When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.U†Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first."UªIt came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!"UXBut he said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it."U∏When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, "This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.UdFor even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.U‡The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.U¥The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.UÅ"No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.U°The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.U>Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn't darkness.UüIf therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light."UaNow as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table.UYWhen the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.UïThe Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.UFYou foolish ones, didn't he who made the outside make the inside also?UkBut give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.UµBut woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.UkWoe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.U}Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don't know it."UNOne of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying this you insult us also."U®He said, "Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won't even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.URWoe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.UiSo you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.UÅTherefore also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,Uxthat the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;Uùfrom the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.' Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.UäWoe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn't enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered."U~As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;Uflying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.t(NUŸMeanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.U_But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.UßTherefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.Ur"I tell you, my friends, don't be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.UáBut I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear him.UV"Aren't five sparrows sold for two assaria coins? Not one of them is forgotten by God.UvBut the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore don't be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.Uq"I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God;U`but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.UâEveryone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.UèWhen they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don't be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;UHfor the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say."U_One of the multitude said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."UIBut he said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?"UëHe said to them, "Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a man's life doesn't consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses."U_He spoke a parable to them, saying, "The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly.UbHe reasoned within himself, saying, 'What will I do, because I don't have room to store my crops?'UÖHe said, 'This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.UoI will tell my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry."'UÜ"But God said to him, 'You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared--whose will they be?'UGSo is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."UéHe said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, don't be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.U;Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.UîConsider the ravens: they don't sow, they don't reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!U<Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?UXIf then you aren't able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?UõConsider the lilies, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.UßBut if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?UHDon't seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.UnFor the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.UBBut seek God's Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.U]Don't be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.U∆Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don't grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn't fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.U:For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.U1"Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning.UèBe like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.U∑Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.UQThey will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.UüBut know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.U\Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don't expect him."UOPeter said to him, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?"UúThe Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?UGBlessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.U<Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.U•But if that servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,U∂then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn't expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn't know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.UtThat servant, who knew his lord's will, and didn't prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,UÕbut he who didn't know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whoever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.UC"I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled.U[But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!U^Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.UcFor from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.U÷They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."UâHe said to the multitudes also, "When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.USWhen a south wind blows, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens.UÑYou hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don't interpret this time?U1Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?UÏFor when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.U\I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny."t(NUÇNow there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.UãJesus answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things?UKI tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.UöOr those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?UMI tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way."U~He spoke this parable. "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.U°He said to the vine dresser, 'Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?'U[He answered, 'Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.UGIf it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.'"U<He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.UâBehold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up.U_When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity."USHe laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.U‰The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, "There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!"UûTherefore the Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water?UåOught not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?"UëAs he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.UFHe said, "What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?U§It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches."U;Again he said, "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?UdIt is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."UXHe went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.UEOne said to him, "Lord, are they few who are saved?" He said to them,Uj"Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.UÔWhen once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!' then he will answer and tell you, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'U_Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'UiHe will say, 'I tell you, I don't know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.'U¢There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.U^They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.UjBehold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last."UrOn that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, "Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you."UëHe said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.UÇNevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can't be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.'UÕ"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!UèBehold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"t(NUÜIt happened, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.U9Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him.UdJesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"UBBut they were silent. He took him, and healed him, and let him go.U|He answered them, "Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, wouldn't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?"U0They couldn't answer him regarding these things.UnHe spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,Uó"When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don't sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,Uêand he who invited both of you would come and tell you, 'Make room for this person.' Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.U⁄But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.U^For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."U‚He also said to the one who had invited him, "When you make a dinner or a supper, don't call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back.ULBut when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;Uäand you will be blessed, because they don't have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous."UâWhen one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, "Blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God!"USBut he said to him, "A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.UkHe sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'UâThey all as one began to make excuses. "The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.'Ue"Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.'UC"Another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I can't come.'U‹"That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.'UP"The servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.'U}"The lord said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.UQFor I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.'"UENow great multitudes were going with him. He turned and said to them,Uú"If anyone comes to me, and doesn't hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can't be my disciple.ULWhoever doesn't bear his own cross, and come after me, can't be my disciple.UFor which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesn't first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?UkOr perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,U=saying, 'This man began to build, and wasn't able to finish.'UºOr what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?UeOr else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.UZSo therefore whoever of you who doesn't renounce all that he has, he can't be my disciple.UUSalt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?UqIt is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile.

He who has ears to hear, let him hear."t(NULNow all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him.U`The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, "This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them."UHe told them this parable.UØ"Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?U@When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.UëWhen he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'UîI tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.UöOr what woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn't light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?UéWhen she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.'UbEven so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting."U%He said, "A certain man had two sons.U|The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of your property.' He divided his livelihood between them.UïNot many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living.UeWhen he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.UpHe went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.UVHe wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.UÉBut when he came to himself he said, 'How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare, and I'm dying with hunger!UoI will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.USI am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants."'U§"He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.U|The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'UÅ"But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe, and put it on him.

They began to celebrate.U^"Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.UBHe called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.UâHe said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.'UUBut he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.UºBut he answered his father, 'Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.UtBut when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.'UM"He said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.UÉBut it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again.

An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions.UéHe called him, and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'U©"The manager said within himself, 'What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don't have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.UiI know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.'UfCalling each one of his lord's debtors to him, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my lord?'UjHe said, 'A hundred batos of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'UáThen said he to another, 'How much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred cors of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'U®"His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.UãI tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.U}He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.UqIf therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?UcIf you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?U¥No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren't able to serve God and mammon."U^The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.U±He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.UíThe law and the prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.UiBut it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.UäEveryone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.Uk"Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.UEA certain beggar, named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores,Uyand desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.UàIt happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried.UeIn Hades, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom.UØHe cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue!

But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish.U¨Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over from there to us.'UU"He said, 'I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house;Ukfor I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they won't also come into this place of torment.'UV"But Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'UX"He said, 'No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'U~"He said to him, 'If they don't listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.'"t(NU~He said to the disciples, "It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!U´It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.UUBe careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.UsIf he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him."U4The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."U¢The Lord said, "If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.U§But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down at the table,'Uîand will not rather tell him, 'Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink'?UVDoes he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.UÑEven so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants.

It happened that as they went, they were cleansed.U[One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.UNHe fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.UBJesus answered, "Weren't the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?UOWere there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?"UJThen he said to him, "Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you."UÖBeing asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, "The Kingdom of God doesn't come with observation;Ufneither will they say, 'Look, here!' or, 'Look, there!' for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you."UÜHe said to the disciples, "The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.UYThey will tell you, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Don't go away, nor follow after them,Uñfor as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.UIBut first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.UZAs it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.UõThey ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.UyLikewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;Ulbut in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.UCIt will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.U£In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.URemember Lot's wife!UQWhoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.UqI tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.UZThere will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left."U UÉThey, answering, asked him, "Where, Lord?" He said to them, "Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together."t(NULHe also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,UYsaying, "There was a judge in a certain city who didn't fear God, and didn't respect man.U[A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'UgHe wouldn't for a while, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,Umyet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.'"U:The Lord said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.UsWon't God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?UwI tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"UxHe spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.U`"Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.U≤The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: 'God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.U6I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.'UîBut the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'U™I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."UxThey were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.UéJesus summoned them, saying, "Allow the little children to come to me, and don't hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.U}Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it."U[A certain ruler asked him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"UKJesus asked him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one--God.UñYou know the commandments: 'Don't commit adultery,' 'Don't murder,' 'Don't steal,' 'Don't give false testimony,' 'Honor your father and your mother.'"U=He said, "I have observed all these things from my youth up."U¥When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me."UIBut when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.UxJesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!UwFor it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."U1Those who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"UNBut he said, "The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."U>Peter said, "Look, we have left everything, and followed you."UûHe said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of God's sake,U[who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life."U∏He took the twelve aside, and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed.U]For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.UFThey will scourge and kill him.

This saying was hidden from them, and they didn't understand the things that were said.USIt happened, as he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.U7Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.U4They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.U:He cried out, "Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"UÄThose who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, "You son of David, have mercy on me!"U^Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,UC"What do you want me to do?" He said, "Lord, that I may see again."UCJesus said to him, "Receive your sight.

If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much."UaJesus said to him, "Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.UAFor the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost."U¢As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately.UoHe said therefore, "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.UlHe called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins, and told them, 'Conduct business until I come.'UkBut his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, 'We don't want this man to reign over us.'U›"It happened when he had come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.UMThe first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.'Uã"He said to him, 'Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'UA"The second came, saying, 'Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.'U9"So he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.'UYAnother came, saying, 'Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,UÉfor I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn't lay down, and reap that which you didn't sow.'Uæ"He said to him, 'Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn't lay down, and reaping that which I didn't sow.UhThen why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?'UgHe said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.'U,"They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!'Uê'For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.UfBut bring those enemies of mine who didn't want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.'"UBHaving said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.U~It happened, when he drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,U†saying, "Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring it.UOIf anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say to him: 'The Lord needs it.'"UIThose who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them.UWAs they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"UThey said, "The Lord needs it."UUThey brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them.U0As he went, they spread their cloaks in the way.U«As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,Uksaying, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!"UWSome of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"USHe answered them, "I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out."U4When he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it,Uzsaying, "If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are hidden from your eyes.UFor the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,U§and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you didn't know the time of your visitation."USHe entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,Ujsaying to them, "It is written, 'My house is a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of robbers'!"UÜHe was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him.U]They couldn't find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said.t(NU§It happened on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, that the priests and scribes came to him with the elders.UiThey asked him, "Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?"U=He answered them, "I also will ask you one question. Tell me:U6the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?"UlThey reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why didn't you believe him?'UiBut if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet."U6They answered that they didn't know where it was from.URJesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."UñHe began to tell the people this parable. "A man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.UúAt the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.UiHe sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.UBHe sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out.UThe lord of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.'Uí"But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'UlThey threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?UÄHe will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others." When they heard it, they said, "May it never be!"UñBut he looked at them, and said, "Then what is this that is written, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief cornerstone?'UkEveryone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust."UüThe chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people--for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.U∑They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.UÖThey asked him, "Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.U4Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"UIBut he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, "Why do you test me?UVShow me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?" They answered, "Caesar's."UjHe said to them, "Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."UkThey weren't able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent.UOSome of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.UµThey asked him, "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.UOThere were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.U3The second took her as wife, and he died childless.UJThe third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.UAfterward the woman also died.U_Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife."UOJesus said to them, "The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.UáBut those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.UwFor they can't die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.UíBut that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord 'The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'UPNow he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him."U8Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you speak well."U/They didn't dare to ask him any more questions.UAHe said to them, "Why do they say that the Christ is David's son?U[David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,U7until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'U7"David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?"U;In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,U†"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;Ujwho devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation."t(NUUHe looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury.U=He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins.UIHe said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,Uzfor all these put in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on."UhAs some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,Uê"As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down."UpThey asked him, "Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?"UùHe said, "Watch out that you don't get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is at hand.' Therefore don't follow them.UÑWhen you hear of wars and disturbances, don't be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end won't come immediately."UTThen he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.U{There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places.

Why do doubts arise in your hearts?UÑSee my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones, as you see that I have."U=When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.UkWhile they still didn't believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"U;They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.U'He took them, and ate in front of them.UΩHe said to them, "This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled."UFThen he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.UÅHe said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,Utand that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.U"You are witnesses of these things.UáBehold, I send forth the promise of my Father on you.

What do you say about yourself?"U{He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said."U3The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.UbThey asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"UVJohn answered them, "I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don't know.UkHe is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to loosen."UNThese things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.UrThe next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!UcThis is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.'UgI didn't know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel."UmJohn testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.U∆I didn't recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, 'On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'U=I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God."UAAgain, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,UIand he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"U;The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.UµJesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What are you looking for?" They said to him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), "where are you staying?"UâHe said to them, "Come, and see." They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.USOne of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.U{He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah!" (which is, being interpreted, Christ).UôHe brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which is by interpretation, Peter).UoOn the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, "Follow me."U?Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.UñPhilip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."UeNathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."UkJesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"UâNathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."UPNathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!"UÜJesus answered him, "Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these!"UïHe said to him, "Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."t(NUPThe third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus' mother was there.U<Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.UFWhen the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no wine."U`Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come."UBHis mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it."U~Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.UVJesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water." They filled them up to the brim.U]He said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast." So they took it.UøWhen the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn't know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,Uüand said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!"UtThis beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.U}After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.UEThe Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.U`He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.UôHe made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables.UrTo those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things out of here! Don't make my Father's house a marketplace!"USHis disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will eat me up."U]The Jews therefore answered him, "What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?"UQJesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."UoThe Jews therefore said, "Forty-six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?"U'But he spoke of the temple of his body.UõWhen therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.U|Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.UABut Jesus didn't trust himself to them, because he knew everyone,Ueand because he didn't need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.t(NUJNow there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.U©The same came to him by night, and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him."UkJesus answered him, "Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can't see the Kingdom of God."U~Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"U{Jesus answered, "Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can't enter into the Kingdom of God!UUThat which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.U9Don't marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born anew.'UûThe wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don't know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."U2Nicodemus answered him, "How can these things be?"UVJesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and don't understand these things?UÇMost certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don't receive our witness.UgIf I told you earthly things and you don't believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?UfNo one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.U[As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,UFthat whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.UÖFor God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.UnFor God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.UùHe who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn't believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.UäThis is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.UkFor everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn't come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.UoBut he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God."UrAfter these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized.UmJohn also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized.U(For John was not yet thrown into prison.UfThere arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with some Jews about purification.U©They came to John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him."UTJohn answered, "A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.U^You yourselves testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent before him.'UΩHe who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.U&He must increase, but I must decrease.UîHe who comes from above is above all. He who is from the Earth belongs to the Earth, and speaks of the Earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.URWhat he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.UKHe who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.U[For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.UAThe Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.UÄOne who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won't see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."t(NUvTherefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than JohnU;(although Jesus himself didn't baptize, but his disciples),U)he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.U"He needed to pass through Samaria.UmSo he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.UyJacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.ULA woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."U:For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.U¶The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, "How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)U®Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."U}The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where then have you that living water?UAre you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?"UIJesus answered her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,U≤but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."UuThe woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I don't get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw."U:Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."U`The woman answered, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You said well, 'I have no husband,'Uhfor you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly."U?The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.UwOur fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."UÑJesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.UeYou worship that which you don't know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.UóBut the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers.UKGod is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."UÑThe woman said to him, "I know that Messiah comes," (he who is called Christ). "When he has come, he will declare to us all things."U8Jesus said to her, "I am he, the one who speaks to you."UõAt this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, "What are you looking for?" or, "Why do you speak with her?"UUSo the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,UL"Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?"U2They went out of the city, and were coming to him.U@In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."UDBut he said to them, "I have food to eat that you don't know about."UWThe disciples therefore said one to another, "Has anyone brought him something to eat?"U^Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.U•Don't you say, 'There are yet four months until the harvest?' Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.U|He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.U>For in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'UsI sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."UäFrom that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, "He told me everything that I did."U`So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.U'Many more believed because of his word.U™They said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world."U@After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.UKFor Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.UúSo when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.UèJesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.UßWhen he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.U\Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe."U@The nobleman said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."UyJesus said to him, "Go your way. Your son lives." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.UWAs he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying "Your child lives!"UçSo he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him."U~So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives." He believed, as did his whole house.UTThis is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.t(NURAfter these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.UpNow in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches.UvIn these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;U¿for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.UBA certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.U|When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to be made well?"UôThe sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another steps down before me."U7Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."UgImmediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.UfSo the Jews said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat."U[He answered them, "He who made me well, the same said to me, 'Take up your mat, and walk.'"UTThen they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Take up your mat, and walk'?"UbBut he who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.UâAfterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you."UMThe man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.UmFor this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.ULBut Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working, so I am working, too."U¨For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.U¿Jesus therefore answered them, "Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.UòFor the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.UjFor as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.UGFor the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,U~that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him.U®"Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn't come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.UÖMost certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God's voice; and those who hear will live.U_For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.UKHe also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.UaDon't marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,Uàand will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.UñI can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.U4"If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.UdIt is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.U9You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.UeBut the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.U^He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.UªBut the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.UyThe Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.URYou don't have his word living in you; because you don't believe him whom he sent.U|"You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.U4Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.UI don't receive glory from men.U=But I know you, that you don't have God's love in yourselves.UrI have come in my Father's name, and you don't receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.UsHow can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God?U|"Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.UGFor if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.UFBut if you don't believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"t(NUvAfter these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.U_A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick.UEJesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.U5Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.UöJesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, "Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?"U?This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.UÅPhilip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little."UAOne of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,U`"There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?"UÉJesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.UµJesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.UyWhen they were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost."UêSo they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.UxWhen therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, "This is truly the prophet who comes into the world."UåJesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.U6When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,Uzand they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.U+The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.UòWhen therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.U0But he said to them, "It is I. Don't be afraid."UuThey were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.T	  On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn't entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.UlHowever boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.UñWhen the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.UbWhen they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"UåJesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.U¢Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him."UQThey said therefore to him, "What must we do, that we may work the works of God?"UYJesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."UsThey said therefore to him, "What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?UjOur fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, 'He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.'"U¶Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.UZFor the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."U>They said therefore to him, "Lord, always give us this bread."UÑJesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.U@But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don't believe.UbAll those who the Father gives me will come to me. Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out.UYFor I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.UâThis is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.U°This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."UlThe Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, "I am the bread which came down out of heaven."UäThey said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'"U>Therefore Jesus answered them, "Don't murmur among yourselves.UgNo one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.UåIt is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.' Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.UWNot that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.UCMost certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.UI am the bread of life.U<Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.UXThis is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.U±I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."UcThe Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"UúJesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don't have life in yourselves.UcHe who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.U:For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.UCHe who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.UwAs the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.UáThis is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever."UAHe said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.UkTherefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?"UpBut Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?UKThen what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?UsIt is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.UñBut there are some of you who don't believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe, and who it was who would betray him.UpHe said, "For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father."UFAt this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.UMJesus said therefore to the twelve, "You don't also want to go away, do you?"UYSimon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.UUWe have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God."URJesus answered them, "Didn't I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"UnNow he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.t(NUuAfter these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn't walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.U<Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.UÉHis brothers therefore said to him, "Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.UÄFor no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world."U,For even his brothers didn't believe in him.UWJesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.U_The world can't hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.UcYou go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled."U7Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.UmBut when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.UDThe Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, "Where is he?"UñThere was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "Not so, but he leads the multitude astray."U4Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.UUBut when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.UbThe Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man know letters, having never been educated?"UMJesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.U{If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.UâHe who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.U^Didn't Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law?

Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?UlHowever we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from."U∂Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don't know.U3I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."UdThey sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.UìBut of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, he won't do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?"UçThe Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.UYThen Jesus said, "I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.UEYou will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come."UûThe Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this man go that we won't find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?UgWhat is this word that he said, 'You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come'?"U~Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!UdHe who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water."UõBut he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn't yet glorified.U`Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, "This is truly the prophet."U]Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?UwHasn't the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"U:So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.UCSome of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.UrThe officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why didn't you bring him?"U9The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"ULThe Pharisees therefore answered them, "You aren't also led astray, are you?U<Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?U:But this multitude that doesn't know the law is accursed."UHNicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,U]"Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?"UjThey answered him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."UEveryone went to his own house,t(NU&but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.U{Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down, and taught them.U]The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the midst,UJthey told him, "Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.URNow in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such. What then do you say about her?"UçThey said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.UãBut when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her."U?Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.U¬They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.U_Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, "Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?"UhShe said, "No one, Lord." Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more."UüAgain, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life."U_The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid."U∫Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don't know where I came from, or where I am going.U1You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.UbEven if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.UHIt's also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.UTI am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me."UòThey said therefore to him, "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither me, nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."UÄJesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.UáJesus said therefore again to them, "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you can't come."UbThe Jews therefore said, "Will he kill himself, that he says, 'Where I am going, you can't come?'"UgHe said to them, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.UxI said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins."UwThey said therefore to him, "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.UöI have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world."U>They didn't understand that he spoke to them about the Father.U≥Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things.UqHe who sent me is with me. The Father hasn't left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him."U/As he spoke these things, many believed in him.UtJesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.U;You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."U~They answered him, "We are Abraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, 'You will be made free?'"UdJesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.UGA bondservant doesn't live in the house forever. A son remains forever.U=If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.UcI know that you are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.UtI say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father."UÉThey answered him, "Our father is Abraham." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.UnBut now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn't do this.UuYou do the works of your father." They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God."UüTherefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven't come of myself, but he sent me.UCWhy don't you understand my speech? Because you can't hear my word.T  You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its father.U3But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.UPWhich of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?UdHe who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don't hear, because you are not of God."U[Then the Jews answered him, "Don't we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?"URJesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.UABut I don't seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.UPMost certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death."U£Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.'UkAre you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?"UÄJesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.UÜYou have not known him, but I know him. If I said, 'I don't know him,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.UEYour father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad."U]The Jews therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"U[Jesus said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM."UôTherefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the midst of them, and so passed by.t(NU/As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.U^His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"UpJesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.UeI must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.U6While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."UsWhen he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud,Uvand said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.UnThe neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, "Isn't this he who sat and begged?"UbOthers were saying, "It is he." Still others were saying, "He looks like him." He said, "I am he."U<They therefore were asking him, "How were your eyes opened?"U§He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight."U<Then they asked him, "Where is he?" He said, "I don't know."U5They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.U=It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.UÜAgain therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."U¡Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them.UTherefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."UßThe Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,UYand asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"UUHis parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;U}but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself."UÆHis parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.U4Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."U|So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."UqHe therefore answered, "I don't know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see."UKThey said to him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"UïHe answered them, "I told you already, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't also want to become his disciples, do you?"UQThey insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.U^We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don't know where he comes from."U_The man answered them, "How amazing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.UwWe know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.UcSince the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.U4If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."U_They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" They threw him out.UgJesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"U:He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"UNJesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you."U1He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshiped him.U}Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind."UbThose of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, "Are we also blind?"UuJesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains.t(NUì"Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn't enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.U?But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.U}The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.UmWhenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.UmThey will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don't know the voice of strangers."UVJesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn't understand what he was telling them.UWJesus therefore said to them again, "Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep's door.UTAll who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them.UmI am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.UmThe thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.UKI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.U©He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.UPThe hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the sheep.U?I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I'm known by my own;UUeven as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.UíI have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.UTTherefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.UßNo one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father."UGTherefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words.UMMany of them said, "He has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?"UâOthers said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn't possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?"U0It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.UGIt was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch.UÑThe Jews therefore came around him and said to him, "How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."UyJesus answered them, "I told you, and you don't believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me.UFBut you don't believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.U<My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.U`I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.UpMy Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand.UI and the Father are one."U1Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him.UqJesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?"U|The Jews answered him, "We don't stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God."UKJesus answered them, "Isn't it written in your law, 'I said, you are gods?'UYIf he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken),U}do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God?'U7If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me.UèBut if I do them, though you don't believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."U>They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.UkHe went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.UmMany came to him. They said, "John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is true."UMany believed in him there.t(NU`Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.U}It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick.UhThe sisters therefore sent to him, saying, "Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick."UÉBut when Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God's Son may be glorified by it."U4Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.UWWhen therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was.UFThen after this he said to the disciples, "Let's go into Judea again."UgThe disciples told him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"UèJesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesn't stumble, because he sees the light of this world.UNBut if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isn't in him."UïHe said these things, and after that, he said to them, "Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep."UOThe disciples therefore said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."UZNow Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.U5So Jesus said to them plainly then, "Lazarus is dead.UgI am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let's go to him."UqThomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let's go also, that we may die with him."ULSo when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.U:Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.UgMany of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.UaThen when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.UbTherefore Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died.UBEven now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you."U2Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."UYMartha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."UoJesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies.UFWhoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"UuShe said to him, "Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God's Son, he who comes into the world."UÄWhen she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here, and is calling you."U8When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.UWNow Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.U¿Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."UßTherefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died."UyWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,UIand said, "Where have you laid him?" They told him, "Lord, come and see."UJesus wept.UAThe Jews therefore said, "See how much affection he had for him!"UuSome of them said, "Couldn't this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?"UlJesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.UüJesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."UWJesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see God's glory?"UöSo they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, "Father, I thank you that you listened to me.UäI know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me."UGWhen he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"UõHe who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Free him, and let him go."UUTherefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.U[But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.U}The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, "What are we doing? For this man does many signs.UÖIf we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."UiBut a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,UÅnor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."UvNow he didn't say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,Uzand not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.ULSo from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.U±Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.UNow the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.UíThen they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, "What do you think--that he isn't coming to the feast at all?"UáNow the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.t(NU}Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.UkSo they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.U¡Mary, therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.USThen Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,UQ"Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?"UéNow he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.UMBut Jesus said, "Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.UEFor you always have the poor with you, but you don't always have me."UØA large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.U=But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,UKbecause on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.UlOn the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,U¢they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!"U@Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,UY"Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt."UøHis disciples didn't understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.UàThe multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.UbFor this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.UvThe Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him."UONow there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.UxThese, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."UWPhilip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.UKJesus answered them, "The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.UíMost certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.UeHe who loves his life will lose it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.UÇIf anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.Uu"Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? 'Father, save me from this time?' But for this cause I came to this time.UÇFather, glorify your name!" Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."UzThe multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."UHJesus answered, "This voice hasn't come for my sake, but for your sakes.UQNow is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out.UIAnd I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."UABut he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die.UßThe multitude answered him, "We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up?' Who is this Son of Man?"U»Jesus therefore said to them, "Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness doesn't overtake you. He who walks in the darkness doesn't know where he is going.UõWhile you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light." Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.UQBut though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didn't believe in him,Uõthat the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, "Lord, who has believed our report? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"U<For this cause they couldn't believe, for Isaiah said again,U§"He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and I would heal them."UAIsaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.UùNevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it, so that they wouldn't be put out of the synagogue,U3for they loved men's praise more than God's praise.U^Jesus cried out and said, "Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.U$He who sees me sees him who sent me.UbI have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.UÇIf anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn't believe, I don't judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.UäHe who rejects me, and doesn't receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day.U~For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.UÄI know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak."t(NU≈Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.UhAfter supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,UzJesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and was going to God,Ularose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.UàThen he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.UIThen he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?"UXJesus answered him, "You don't know what I am doing now, but you will understand later."UvPeter said to him, "You will never wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I don't wash you, you have no part with me."UQSimon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"UãJesus said to him, "Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you."UQFor he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, "You are not all clean."UãSo when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?UEYou call me, 'Teacher' and 'Lord.' You say so correctly, for so I am.UfIf I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.UOFor I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.UxMost certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him.U9If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.UßI don't speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.'U^From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he.U{Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me."UWhen Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."UCThe disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke.UXOne of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus' breast.U^Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, "Tell us who it is of whom he speaks."ULHe, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast, asked him, "Lord, who is it?"UΩJesus therefore answered, "It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it." So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.UiAfter the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly."U5Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him.U°For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, "Buy what things we need for the feast," or that he should give something to the poor.UNTherefore, having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.UlWhen he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.UlIf God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.UûLittle children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you can't come,' so now I tell you.UwA new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just like I have loved you; that you also love one another.UXBy this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."UèSimon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you can't follow now, but you will follow afterwards."UWPeter said to him, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."UêJesus answered him, "Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won't crow until you have denied me three times.t(NUF"Don't let your heart be troubled. Believe in God.

Jesus said to them, "I am he." Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.UVWhen therefore he said to them, "I am he," they went backward, and fell to the ground.UYAgain therefore he asked them, "Who are you looking for?" They said, "Jesus of Nazareth."U\Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,"Uethat the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, "Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none."UêSimon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.UÉJesus therefore said to Peter, "Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?"UdSo the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,U`and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.UiNow it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.U°Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;Ußbut Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.UoThen the maid who kept the door said to Peter, "Are you also one of this man's disciples?" He said, "I am not."UµNow the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.URThe high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.UôJesus answered him, "I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret.UpWhy do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said."UÜWhen he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, "Do you answer the high priest like that?"UbJesus answered him, "If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?"U2Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.U¢Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, "You aren't also one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, and said, "I am not."UçOne of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn't I see you in the garden with him?"UDPeter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.UªThey led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.U]Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?"U_They answered him, "If this man weren't an evildoer, we wouldn't have delivered him up to you."U¨Pilate therefore said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law." Therefore the Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,"Ujthat the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.UrPilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"USJesus answered him, "Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?"UvPilate answered, "I'm not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?"U¡Jesus answered, "My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn't be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here."T  Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you a king then?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."UóPilate said to him, "What is truth?" When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, "I find no basis for a charge against him.UéBut you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"U]Then they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.t(NU+So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him.UfThe soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.UGThey kept saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and they kept slapping him.UêThen Pilate went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him."UuJesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, "Behold, the man!"UœWhen therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him."UoThe Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."U<When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.UlHe entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.UäPilate therefore said to him, "Aren't you speaking to me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?"UöJesus answered, "You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin."UªAt this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you release this man, you aren't Caesar's friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!"UùWhen Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called "The Pavement," but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha."UrNow it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"U®They cried out, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"UVSo then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.UrHe went out, bearing his cross, to the place called "The Place of a Skull," which is called in Hebrew, "Golgotha,"U_where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.UqPilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."UúTherefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.UÖThe chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don't write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'he said, I am King of the Jews.'"U7Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."U¬Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.T  Then they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be," that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, "They parted my garments among them. For my cloak they cast lots." Therefore the soldiers did these things.UBut there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.UÑTherefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son!"UkThen he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.UyAfter this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."UyNow a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.UtWhen Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.UTherefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.UjTherefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;UZbut when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs.UdHowever one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.UqHe who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.UeFor these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of him will not be broken."UHAgain another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom they pierced."U‚After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.UxNicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.UmSo they took Jesus' body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.UÄNow in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.U`Then because of the Jews' Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.t(NUéNow on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.U≈Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have laid him!"UOTherefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.UTThey both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.UOStooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn't enter in.U_Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,Umand the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.U_So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.UKFor as yet they didn't know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.U4So the disciples went away again to their own homes.UiBut Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,Upand she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.UëThey told her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have laid him."UdWhen she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus.U›Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?" She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away."U_Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him, "Rhabbouni!" which is to say, "Teacher!"U∫Jesus said to her, "Don't touch me, for I haven't yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"UpMary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.UÁWhen therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace be to you."UwWhen he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.UeJesus therefore said to them again, "Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you."UWWhen he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit!UhWhoever's sins you forgive, they are forgiven them. Whoever's sins you retain, they have been retained."UPBut Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with them when Jesus came.UøThe other disciples therefore said to him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."U§After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace be to you."UóThen he said to Thomas, "Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don't be unbelieving, but believing."U*Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"UyJesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed."UjTherefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;Uábut these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.t(NUwAfter these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.UâSimon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.U≥Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing." They told him, "We are also coming with you." They immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.UiBut when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn't know that it was Jesus.U\Jesus therefore said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?" They answered him, "No."U±He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.UÀThat disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord!" So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.UòBut the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish.UaSo when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.UHJesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have just caught."UîSimon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net wasn't torn.UÜJesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast." None of the disciples dared inquire of him, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Lord.UKThen Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.UfThis is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.UﬂSo when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."U∞He said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep."T"  He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?" Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, "Do you have affection for me?" He said to him, "Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.U„Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you don't want to go."U|Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, "Follow me."U—Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, "Lord, who is going to betray You?"U=Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man?"U_Jesus said to him, "If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me."U»This saying therefore went out among the brothers, that this disciple wouldn't die. Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, but, "If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?"UpThis is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true.U≤There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.ttq,(UActs(NU[The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,UÖuntil the day in which he was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.UôTo these he also showed himself alive after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about God's Kingdom.UïBeing assembled together with them, he commanded them, "Don't depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me.UgFor John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."UlTherefore, when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"UnHe said to them, "It isn't for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority.U∞But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth."UrWhen he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.UmWhile they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing,U√who also said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky."UwThen they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.U‰When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.UñAll these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.U}In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,U∂"Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.UGFor he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry.UèNow this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed out.UäIt became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called 'Akeldama,' that is, 'The field of blood.'UçFor it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his habitation be made desolate. Let no one dwell therein;' and, 'Let another take his office.'Uh"Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,Uêbeginning from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection."UUThey put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.UnThey prayed, and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosenUmto take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place."UdThey drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.t(NUSNow when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place.UÄSuddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.UUTongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them.UÅThey were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.UWNow there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky.UÜWhen this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language.UhThey were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, "Behold, aren't all these who speak Galileans?U4How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?UYParthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,UjPhrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,UVCretans and Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God!"UWThey were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, "What does this mean?"U7Others, mocking, said, "They are filled with new wine."UºBut Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, "You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.UVFor these aren't drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day.U:But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel:U¡'It will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions. Your old men will dream dreams.UoYes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days, I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.UlI will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.UsThe sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.UJIt will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.'Uæ"Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,Uåhim, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;Uwwhom God raised up, having freed him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.U}For David says concerning him, 'I saw the Lord always before my face, For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.U_Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;U_because you will not leave my soul in Hades, neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.U]You made known to me the ways of life. You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'U"Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.U∏Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,UÑhe foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul left in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.U8This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.U©Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.UpFor David didn't ascend into the heavens, but he says himself, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit by my right hand,U6until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'UÅ"Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."UÉNow when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"U™Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.UÑFor to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself."UnWith many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"UlThen those who gladly received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.UjThey continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer.USFear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.U=All who believed were together, and had all things in common.UaThey sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.UôDay by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,Uypraising God, and having favor with all the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.t(NUSPeter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.UœA certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple.U[Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy.U@Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, "Look at us."U>He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.UäBut Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!"UmHe took him by the right hand, and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.UrLeaping up, he stood, and began to walk. He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.U0All the people saw him walking and praising God.U¿They recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.UóAs the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.U¬When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?U¬The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.UYBut you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,UXand killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.U¥By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.UO"Now, brothers, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers.UrBut the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.Uè"Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord,UCand that he may send Christ Jesus, who was ordained for you before,UÇwhom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets.UµFor Moses indeed said to the fathers, 'The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you.UrIt will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'UyYes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.U´You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.'UÖGod, having raised up his servant, Jesus, sent him to you first, to bless you, in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness."t(NUfAs they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,Ubbeing upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.U\They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.UhBut many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.UgIt happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.UrAnnas the high priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest.UtWhen they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"UgThen Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,Uoif we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,UÀbe it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole.UpHe is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.'UàThere is salvation in none other, for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved!"U¨Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus.UTSeeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.UaBut when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,U∞saying, "What shall we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can't deny it.UÖBut so that this spreads no further among the people, let's threaten them, that from now on they don't speak to anyone in this name."UXThey called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.UÖBut Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,U=for we can't help telling the things which we saw and heard."U¢When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.UXFor the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old.UvBeing let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.U®When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, "O Lord, you are God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;Ukwho by the mouth of your servant, David, said, 'Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?UuThe kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take council together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.'UØ"For truly, in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered togetherUAto do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen.UbNow, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,U}while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus."U¶When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.U∂The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.UwWith great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was on them all.U†For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,Ueand laid them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need.UàJoses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,UQhaving a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.t(NULBut a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold a possession,UÄand kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.UÑBut Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?UªWhile you kept it, didn't it remain your own? After it was sold, wasn't it in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You haven't lied to men, but to God."U`Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things.UPThe young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.UJAbout three hours later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.UbPeter answered her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much." She said, "Yes, for so much."UƒBut Peter asked her, "How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."UíShe fell down immediately at his feet, and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.UIGreat fear came on the whole assembly, and on all who heard these things.UÅBy the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.UENone of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them.UHMore believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.UßThey even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them.U†Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed.UÜBut the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,U?and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody.UZBut an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,UL"Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."T  When they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.UUBut the officers who came didn't find them in the prison. They returned and reported,UÅ"We found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!"U†Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.UuOne came and told them, "Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people."UÇThen the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them.U^When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,U•saying, "Didn't we strictly command you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us."UGBut Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.UOThe God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a tree.UuGod exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.UpWe are His witnesses of these things; and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."USBut they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and determined to kill them.U¶But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while.U_He said to them, "You men of Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do.U›For before these days Theudas rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.UµAfter this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him. He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.UÅNow I tell you, withdraw from these men, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown.UsBut if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting against God!"UÉThey agreed with him. Summoning the apostles, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.UÖThey therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for Jesus' name.UbEvery day, in the temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus, the Christ.t(NUπNow in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.UáThe twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, "It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.UìTherefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.ULBut we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."UªThese words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;UWwhom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.UôThe word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.UUStephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.UØBut some of those who were of the synagogue called "The Libertines," and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.UKThey weren't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.UiThen they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."UÄThey stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the council,Uzand set up false witnesses who said, "This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.UàFor we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us."UgAll who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.t(NU,The high priest said, "Are these things so?"UéHe said, "Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,Umand said to him, 'Get out of your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.'U°Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living.U∫He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no child.UìGod spoke in this way: that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.UÜ'I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,' said God, 'and after that will they come out, and serve me in this place.'UÃHe gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.U["The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him,Uùand delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.UiNow a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.U[But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.UdOn the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race was revealed to Pharaoh.UWJoseph sent, and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.UAJacob went down into Egypt, and he died, himself and our fathers,Uåand they were brought back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem.Us"But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,U;until there arose a different king, who didn't know Joseph.UçThe same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they wouldn't stay alive.UoAt that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father's house.UVWhen he was thrown out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son.U^Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and works.UfBut when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.UkSeeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.UxHe supposed that his brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance; but they didn't understand.Uú"The day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, 'Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?'UeBut he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?U>Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'UoMoses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.UÜ"When forty years were fulfilled, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.UfWhen Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,U'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' Moses trembled, and dared not look.UhThe Lord said to him, 'Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.U®I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into Egypt.'U∑"This Moses, whom they refused, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.UwThis man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.UçThis is that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, 'The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me.'U¶This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received living oracles to give to us,Ueto whom our fathers wouldn't be obedient, but rejected him, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,Uôsaying to Aaron, 'Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.'UnThey made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.U–But God turned, and gave them up to serve the army of the sky, as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'Did you offer to me slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?UêYou took up the tabernacle of Moloch, the star of your god Rephan, the figures which you made to worship. I will carry you away beyond Babylon.'U•"Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen;Uºwhich also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered into the possession of the nations, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David,UYwho found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.UBut Solomon built him a house.UUHowever, the Most High doesn't dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says,Uî'heaven is my throne, and the earth a footstool for my feet. What kind of house will you build me?' says the Lord; 'or what is the place of my rest?U&Didn't my hand make all these things?'Uy"You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers did, so you do.U©Which of the prophets didn't your fathers persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.UGYou received the law as it was ordained by angels, and didn't keep it!"UgNow when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth.UêBut he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,Ucand said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!"U`But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at him with one accord.UzThey threw him out of the city, and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.UNThey stoned Stephen as he called out, saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"U~He kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, don't hold this sin against them!" When he had said this, he fell asleep.t(NUŸSaul was consenting to his death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.U9Devout men buried Stephen, and lamented greatly over him.UgBut Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison.UITherefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word.UKPhilip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.UÅThe multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did.UñFor unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.U!There was great joy in that city.U†But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,Uito whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is that great power of God."UTThey listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.UïBut when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.UÄSimon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed.U~Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,UWwho, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;Ubfor as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.UFThen they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.UvNow when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,U^saying, "Give me also this power, that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."UyBut Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!UTYou have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn't right before God.UpRepent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.UQFor I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."UfSimon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me."UûThey therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans.UñBut an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert."UƒHe arose and went; and behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.UPHe was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.UHThe Spirit said to Philip, "Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."UpPhilip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"UeHe said, "How can I, unless someone explains it to me?" He begged Philip to come up and sit with him.UÆNow the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter. As a lamb before his shearer is silent, so he doesn't open his mouth.UxIn his humiliation, his judgment was taken away. Who will declare His generation? For his life is taken from the earth."UeThe eunuch answered Philip, "Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?"URPhilip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus.UáAs they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being baptized?"U UÅHe commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.UòWhen they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn't see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing.UxBut Philip was found at Azotus. Passing through, he preached the Good News to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.t(NUkBut Saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,U•and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.UnAs he traveled, it happened that he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him.U]He fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"USHe said, "Who are you, Lord?" The Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.UMBut rise up, and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do."UUThe men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one.UÇSaul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.U?He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.UäNow there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias!" He said, "Behold, it's me, Lord."UÆThe Lord said to him, "Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judah for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,Uyand in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight."UuBut Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem.UPHere he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name."UåBut the Lord said to him, "Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings, and the children of Israel.UGFor I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake."UÓAnanias departed, and entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."UkImmediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized.UdHe took food and was strengthened. Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus.URImmediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ, that he is the Son of God.U√All who heard him were amazed, and said, "Isn't this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!"UtBut Saul increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.UGWhen many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together to kill him,Uhbut their plot became known to Saul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,Uabut his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.UíWhen Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.U—But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.U)He was with them entering into Jerusalem,UÄpreaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus. He spoke and disputed against the Hellenists, but they were seeking to kill him.UYWhen the brothers knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus.UπSo the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.UjIt happened, as Peter went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.UlThere he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed.UdPeter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!" Immediately he arose.UJAll who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.U†Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did.UtIt happened in those days that she fell sick, and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.UàAs Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them.U“Peter got up and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber. All the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.UûPeter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, get up!" She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.U_He gave her his hand, and raised her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.UHAnd it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.UHIt happened, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.t(NUpNow there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,Uâa devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God.U}At about the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, "Cornelius!"U∞He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, "What is it, Lord?" He said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God.U<Now send men to Joppa, and get Simon, who is surnamed Peter.UCHe lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."UôWhen the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually.U;Having explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.UÇNow on the next day as they were on their journey, and got close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon.UZHe became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance.UyHe saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,Ujin which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky.U1A voice came to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat!"UZBut Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."U^A voice came to him again the second time, "What God has cleansed, you must not call unclean."URThis was done three times, and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven.U≈Now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,UNand called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there.UZWhile Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men seek you.UOBut arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them."UYPeter went down to the men, and said, "Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?"U’They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say."UéSo he called them in and lodged them. On the next day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.UÜOn the next day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends.UaWhen it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.UDBut Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up! I myself am also a man."UCAs he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together.U–He said to them, "You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I shouldn't call any man unholy or unclean.UgTherefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"U°Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour, I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,Ukand said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God.U°Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside. When he comes, he will speak to you.'U≥Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God."UTPeter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism;URbut in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.UsThe word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ--he is Lord of all--Uèthat spoken word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;U≤even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.UÜWe are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they also killed, hanging him on a tree.U=God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,UÖnot to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.UáHe commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.UwAll the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins."UaWhile Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.UóThey of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.UXFor they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,Ur"Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?"UdHe commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days.t(NUnNow the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.U[When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,U>saying, "You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!"U8But Peter began, and explained to them in order, saying,U∫"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me.UíWhen I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky.U?I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat!'UYBut I said, 'Not so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'UgBut a voice answered me the second time out of heaven, 'What God has cleansed, don't you call unclean.'UCThis was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.UgBehold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.UàThe Spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house.UÖHe told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa, and get Simon, whose surname is Peter,UPwho will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your house.'URAs I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.U}I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'UÄIf then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?"UèWhen they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!"U∑They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews only.UçBut there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus.UWThe hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.UÉThe report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem. They sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,Uïwho, when he had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain near to the Lord.UhFor he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.U-Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look for Saul.U“When he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. It happened, that for a whole year they were gathered together with the assembly, and taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.U@Now in these days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.U£One of them named Agabus stood up, and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius.UfAs any of the disciples had plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;UPwhich they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.t(NU\Now about that time, Herod the king stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly.U5He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.UuWhen he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This was during the days of unleavened bread.U±When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.UdPeter therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him.U¢The same night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.UªAnd behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side, and woke him up, saying, "Stand up quickly!" His chains fell off from his hands.U|The angel said to him, "Get dressed and put on your sandals." He did so. He said to him, "Put on your cloak, and follow me."U}And he went out and followed him. He didn't know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.UﬁWhen they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went out, and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.U¡When Peter had come to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting."UëThinking about that, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.UNWhen Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.UãWhen she recognized Peter's voice, she didn't open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that Peter was standing in front of the gate.UaThey said to her, "You are crazy!" But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."URBut Peter continued knocking. When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.UﬂBut he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, "Tell these things to James, and to the brothers." Then he departed, and went to another place.UeNow as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter.U≤When Herod had sought for him, and didn't find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.UÙNow Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus, the king's personal aide, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.UkOn an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them.U;The people shouted, "The voice of a god, and not of a man!"UvImmediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he didn't give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.U(But the word of God grew and multiplied.UÇBarnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also taking with them John whose surname was Mark.t(NU¬Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.UàAs they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them."UXThen, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.UdSo, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.U{When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They had also John as their attendant.UÅWhen they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar Jesus,Uåwho was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.UÇBut Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.UYBut Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,Uûand said, "Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?U Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!" Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.UfThen the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.UÅNow Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.U{But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.UßAfter the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak."U^Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.U¢The God of this people chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it.UHFor a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.UäWhen he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred fifty years.U@After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.U|Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.UÆWhen he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also testified, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'USFrom this man's seed, God has brought salvation to Israel according to his promise,UTbefore his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to Israel.U¨As John was fulfilling his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'U|Brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent out to you.U∞For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn't know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.UQThough they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed.UyWhen they had fulfilled all things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.U!But God raised him from the dead,U{and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.U:We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,U∞that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second psalm, 'You are my Son. Today I have become your father.'U°"Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'UYTherefore he says also in another psalm, 'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'UÉFor David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw decay.U'But he whom God raised up saw no decay.UeBe it known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,Uyand by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.UHBeware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:Uî'Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you.'"U|So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.U≠Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.UUThe next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.UåBut when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.U„Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, "It was necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.UùFor so has the Lord commanded us, saying, 'I have set you as a light for the Gentiles, that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"U~As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.U<The Lord's word was spread abroad throughout all the region.U≤But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.ULBut they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.U8The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.t(NUöIt happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.UcBut the disbelieving Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers.U£Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.U`But the multitude of the city was divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.UrWhen some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,Ugthey became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.U"There they preached the Good News.UjAt Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.UmHe was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,UNsaid with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" He leaped up and walked.U¢When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"UUThey called Barnabas "Jupiter," and Paul "Mercury," because he was the chief speaker.U¢The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes.UzBut when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,UÌ"Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;UQwho in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.U¢Yet he didn't leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."U]Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them.U¶But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.UÅBut as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.U~When they had preached the Good News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,Uòconfirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God.UìWhen they had appointed elders for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.U3They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.UBWhen they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.UÄFrom there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.UØWhen they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.U5They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.t(NUÇSome men came down from Judea and taught the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you can't be saved."U–Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.UÆThey, being sent on their way by the assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the brothers.UûWhen they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all things that God had done with them.UóBut some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."ULThe apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.U‹When there had been much discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News, and believe.UdGod, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us.ULHe made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.UèNow therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?UXBut we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are."UîAll the multitude kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the nations through them.U@After they were silent, James answered, "Brothers, listen to me.UaSimeon has reported how God first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for his name.U=This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,Uê'After these things I will return. I will again build the tabernacle of David, which has fallen. I will again build its ruins. I will set it up,UÉThat the rest of men may seek after the Lord; All the Gentiles who are called by my name, Says the Lord, who does all these things.U.All his works are known to God from eternity.'U^"Therefore my judgment is that we don't trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God,Uàbut that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.UvFor Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath."U‚Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers.U¶They wrote these things by their hand: "The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: greetings.UΩBecause we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, 'You must be circumcised and keep the law,' to whom we gave no commandment;U{it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,UFmen who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.UkWe have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.UnFor it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things:U∏that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. Farewell."UuSo, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.U<When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.UpJudas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and strengthened them.UkAfter they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles.U UlBut Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.U¶After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing."UCBarnabas planned to take John, who was called Mark, with them also.UôBut Paul didn't think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and didn't go with them to do the work.U~Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away to Cyprus,UXbut Paul chose Silas, and went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God.U@He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.t(NUìHe came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess who believed; but his father was a Greek.ULThe brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him.U§Paul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.U¢As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.UPSo the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.UWhen they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.UdWhen they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit didn't allow them.U*Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.UèA vision appeared to Paul in the night. There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."UíWhen he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them.UnSetting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;Uèand from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.U≤On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together.UπA certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.UßWhen she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay." So she persuaded us.UòIt happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.U{Following Paul and us, she cried out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us a way of salvation!"U¿She was doing this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" It came out that very hour.UìBut when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.UiWhen they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men, being Jews, are agitating our city,U[and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans."UãThe multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods.UnWhen they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,Ulwho, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.UrBut about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.U®Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened.UüThe jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.UUBut Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, "Don't harm yourself, for we are all here!"USHe called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,UBand brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"U]They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household."UIThey spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house.UzHe took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.UÇHe brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having believed in God.UTBut when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, "Let those men go."UÑThe jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace."U›But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No, most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!"UrThe sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,Ugand they came and begged them. When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.UÅThey went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia's house. When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.t(NUyNow when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.UlPaul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,Uôexplaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ."UÅSome of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women.U«But the unpersuaded Jews took along some wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.U¨When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying, "These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,Utwhom Jason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!"UTThe multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.UGWhen they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.U}The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.U∏Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.UVMany of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few men.UüBut when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.UqThen the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there.U†But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly, they departed.UnNow while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.U~So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him.UÊSome of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also were conversing with him. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "He seems to be advocating foreign deities," because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.UÄThey took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?UdFor you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean."UÑNow all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.U~Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, "You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things.U√For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: 'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.U~The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn't dwell in temples made with hands,UÇneither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things.U†He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings,Uthat they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.Uy'For in him we live, and move, and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'UìBeing then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man.UnThe times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,U«because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead."UNow when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, "We want to hear you again concerning this."U#Thus Paul went out from among them.UçBut certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.t(NUBAfter these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.U He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He came to them,Ukand because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.UJHe reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.UàBut when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.U®When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!"UåHe departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.UìCrispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.U`The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, "Don't be afraid, but speak and don't be silent;U`for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city."UJHe lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.UÄBut when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,UDsaying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."U∫But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;Uäbut if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don't want to be a judge of these matters."U%He drove them from the judgment seat.UúThen all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio didn't care about any of these things.U∆Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.UrHe came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.UAWhen they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;U´but taking his leave of them, and saying, "I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus.U^When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.UâHaving spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.U{Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures.U∏This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.UùHe began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.U¬When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;Uafor he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.t(NUåIt happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.UêHe said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said to him, "No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."UNHe said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into John's baptism."UßPaul said, "John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus."UGWhen they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.UwWhen Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied.U"They were about twelve men in all.UñHe entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God.U∫But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.UyThis continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.U1God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,Upso that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out.UºBut some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."UHThere were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.UKThe evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?"UúThe man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.UäThis became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.UPMany also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.UæMany of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.U8So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty.UæNow after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."UsHaving sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.U=About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.UÇFor a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,UÉwhom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, "Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.UπYou see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.U’Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships."UmWhen they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"UØThe whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.UKWhen Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples didn't allow him.UlCertain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.UâSome therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn't know why they had come together.UôThey brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people.UãBut when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"UÈWhen the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?U]Seeing then that these things can't be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.UhFor you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.U≤If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another.UYBut if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.U®For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause. Concerning it, we wouldn't be able to give an account of this commotion."U3When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.t(NUpAfter the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.UcWhen he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words, he came into Greece.UüWhen he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.U§These accompanied him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.U;But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.UÑWe sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.UºOn the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight.ULThere were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.U A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.UgPaul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said, "Don't be troubled, for his life is in him."UÇWhen he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.U:They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.UìBut we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.UBWhen he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.UûSailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus.U∫For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.URFrom Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly.UéWhen they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,Usserving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;Uvhow I didn't shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,U]testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.U]Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;Ucexcept that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.UÿBut these things don't count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God.Ur"Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God, will see my face no more.UNTherefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men,UCfor I didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.UøTake heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood.UbFor I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.UkMen will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.U{Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I didn't cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.U°Now, brothers, I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.U0I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing.UWYou yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me.U√In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"UHWhen he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.U<They all wept a lot, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,Uãsorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.t(NUúWhen it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.UMHaving found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.UïWhen we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo.UÅHaving found disciples, we stayed there seven days. These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.U◊When it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.U\After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.UzWhen we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.U≥On the next day, we, who were Paul's companions, departed, and came to Caesarea. We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.U6Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.URAs we stayed there some days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.U„Coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit: 'So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'"U`When we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.U™Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."UMWhen he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The Lord's will be done."UAAfter these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.UÅSome of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.U?When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.URThe day following, Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.UyWhen he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.UªThey, when they heard it, glorified God. They said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.UºThey have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.USWhat then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.UETherefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.U¸Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law.UÒBut concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality."UÀThen Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.UìWhen the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,U’crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!"U}For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.UâAll the city was moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut.U|As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.UêImmediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.UçThen the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.U¶Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd. When he couldn't find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.UqWhen he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;ULfor the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, "Away with him!"UÜAs Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, "May I speak to you?" He said, "Do you know Greek?UìAren't you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?"UÑBut Paul said, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."U∂When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,t(NUF"Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now make to you."UaWhen they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. He said,U›"I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are this day.U[I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.U÷As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.UäIt happened that, as I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me.U_I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'U]I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.'Uz"Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they didn't understand the voice of him who spoke to me.UüI said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Arise, and go into Damascus. There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.'UwWhen I couldn't see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.UgOne Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,Utcame to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' In that very hour I looked up at him.UÜHe said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.UMFor you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.UcNow why do you wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.'Ul"It happened that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,UÉand saw him saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you.'UlI said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you.UôWhen the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.'UQ"He said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the Gentiles.'"UçThey listened to him until he said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, "Rid the earth of this fellow, for he isn't fit to live!"UKAs they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,Uµthe commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like that.UõWhen they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?"UáWhen the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, "Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman!"UVThe commanding officer came and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes."UrThe commanding officer answered, "I bought my citizenship for a great price." Paul said, "But I was born a Roman."U≠Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.UÁBut on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.t(NUzPaul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, "Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day."UVThe high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.U°Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?"U;Those who stood by said, "Do you malign God's high priest?"UáPaul said, "I didn't know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"UÎBut when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"UkWhen he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.UsFor the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.UÃA great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying, "We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let's not fight against God!"U—When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.UöThe following night, the Lord stood by him, and said, "Cheer up, Paul, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome."UüWhen it was day, some of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.U?There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.UíThey came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.UŸNow therefore, you with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are ready to kill him before he comes near."UnBut Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.UÇPaul summoned one of the centurions, and said, "Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him."U≤So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer, and said, "Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to tell you."UyThe commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"UùHe said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.U‚Therefore don't yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."UvSo the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, "Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me."UÃHe called to himself two of the centurions, and said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night."UnHe asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.UHe wrote a letter like this:UA"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.Uò"This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.UUDesiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.UI found him to be accused about questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of death or of imprisonment.UÆWhen I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you. Farewell."U]So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.UXBut on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks.UeWhen they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.UxWhen the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,Ug"I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive." He commanded that he be kept in Herod's palace.t(NUèAfter five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.UöWhen he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,UXwe accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.UPBut, that I don't delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.U°For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.U9He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.U UUBy examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him."UHThe Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.U¶When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,Ukseeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.UyIn the temple they didn't find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.UANor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.U≈But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;Uâhaving hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.UUHerein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.UVNow after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;Udamid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.UaThey ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.UeOr else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,Uêunless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!'"UùBut Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case."U°He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.UëBut after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.U¿As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you."UùMeanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.UçBut when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.t(NUeFestus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.UfThen the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him,Ucasking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill him on the way.UyHowever Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly.Uç"Let them therefore," said he, "that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him."UûWhen he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.UòWhen he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove,UÜwhile he said in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all."U•But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these things?"UïBut Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.UÕFor if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I don't refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!"UuThen Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall go."UdNow when some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.UÄAs he stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;UÅabout whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him.UÁTo whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, before the accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.UéWhen therefore they had come together here, I didn't delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought.UaConcerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;UÇbut had certain questions against him about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.UóBeing perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.UÑBut when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."UnAgrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he said, "you shall hear him."U‡So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.UÿFestus said, "King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.UÉBut when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.UƒOf whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write.UeFor it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him."t(NUkAgrippa said to Paul, "You may speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.Ué"I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things that I am accused by the Jews,UÇespecially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.U~"Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;UÅhaving known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.UUNow I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,UÜwhich our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa!UAWhy is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?Uj"I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.U∫This I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.UùPunishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.U^"Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests,UÄat noon, O King, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me.U±When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'UN"I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' "He said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.UÃBut arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you;UJdelivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,UÃto open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'UG"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,U√but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.UGFor this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me.UÆHaving therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen,Uîhow the Christ must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles."U}As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!"UjBut he said, "I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness.U©For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner.UDKing Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."UWAgrippa said to Paul, "With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?"UßPaul said, "I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these bonds."UMThe king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.UpWhen they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, "This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."U]Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."t(NUòWhen it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.U§Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.UÄThe next day, we touched at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself.U^Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.UgWhen we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.UYThere the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board.U®When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.UgWith difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.U{When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them,Uíand said to them, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."U{But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul.U’Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.UåWhen the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.UPBut before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Euroclydon.U_When the ship was caught, and couldn't face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along.UiRunning under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.UæAfter they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along.U\As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.UHOn the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands.UãWhen neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.U√When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.U`Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.U\For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,Uwsaying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'U_Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.U-But we must run aground on a certain island."U´But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.UzThey took soundings, and found twenty fathoms. After a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.UtFearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight.UìAs the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,UdPaul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these stay in the ship, you can't be saved."UFThen the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.U¶While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.UwTherefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads."U|When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat.U2Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.U:In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.UYWhen they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.UêWhen it was day, they didn't recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it.UùCasting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.U´But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.U`The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.U±But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;Uåand the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land.t(NUHWhen we had escaped, then they learned that the island was called Malta.UåThe natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.UàBut when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.UƒWhen the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed to live."UCHowever he shook off the creature into the fire, and wasn't harmed.U…But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.U©Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for three days.UêIt happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.U[Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured.UgThey also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.U}After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Brothers."U1Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.UÖFrom there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,Uawhere we found brothers, and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome.U´From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.UßWhen we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.T1  It happened that after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,Ubwho, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.UÉBut when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.UÅFor this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."UîThey said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.UÖBut we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."U˘When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.UASome believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.U¢When they didn't agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, "The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,Uîsaying, 'Go to this people, and say, in hearing, you will hear, but will in no way understand. In seeing, you will see, but will in no way perceive.UÓFor this people's heart has grown callous. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.'Uh"Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations. They will also listen."UYWhen he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.U]Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him,U|preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.ttq-(URomans(NU]Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God,UEwhich he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,UMconcerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,Uêwho was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,Urthrough whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake;U9among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ;UÇto all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.UtFirst, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.UâFor God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,U]requesting, if by any means now at last I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.UlFor I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established;Uhthat is, that I with you may be encouraged in you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine.UƒNow I don't desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.URI am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.UXSo, as much as is in me, I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome.UüFor I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes; for the Jew first, and also for the Greek.UyFor in it is revealed God's righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, "But the righteous shall live by faith."UãFor the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,UTbecause that which is known of God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them.UÕFor the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse.UñBecause, knowing God, they didn't glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.U4Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,Uöand traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.UÖTherefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,UÜwho exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.UÉFor this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature.U–Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.UÑEven as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;U®being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,Ujbackbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,U]without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;Uûwho, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them.t(NU™Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.U^We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.U~Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?UÜOr do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?U§But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;U9who "will pay back to everyone according to their works:"Uato those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;Uubut to those who are self-seeking, and don't obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,Ueoppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.UdBut glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.U$For there is no partiality with God.UàFor as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.UlFor it isn't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justifiedUÅ(for when Gentiles who don't have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,U©in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)U^in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.UIIndeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,U^and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,Ucand are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,Uja corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.UsYou therefore who teach another, don't you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn't steal, do you steal?UmYou who say a man shouldn't commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?USYou who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?U]For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you," just as it is written.UïFor circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.UuIf therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?UìWon't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?UeFor he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;Uòbut he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.t(NUMThen what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision?UUMuch in every way! Because first of all, they were entrusted with the oracles of God.U^For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?U∞May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, "That you might be justified in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment."UãBut if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.U7May it never be! For then how will God judge the world?UeFor if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?UóWhy not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), "Let us do evil, that good may come?" Those who say so are justly condemned.U~What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.U:As it is written, "There is no one righteous; no, not one.UEThere is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks after God.U|They have all turned aside. They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one."Uv"Their throat is an open tomb. With their tongues they have used deceit."  "The poison of vipers is under their lips;"U0"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."U$"Their feet are swift to shed blood.U)Destruction and misery are in their ways.U&The way of peace, they haven't known."U,"There is no fear of God before their eyes."U¥Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.UyBecause by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.UrBut now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;U}even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction,U8for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;USbeing justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;U±whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God's forbearance;UÜto demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.UgWhere then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what manner of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.UWWe maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.UYOr is God the God of Jews only? Isn't he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,Umsince indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.UTDo we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law.t(NUUWhat then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?U[For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward God.UgFor what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."UFNow to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as debt.UuBut to him who doesn't work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.UdEven as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,UH"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.UCBlessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin."UîIs this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.UwHow then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.T  He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them.U≠The father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.UéFor the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn't through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.UdFor if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.URFor the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience.UFor this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.U«As it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations." This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were.UùWho in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, "So will your seed be."UßWithout being weakened in faith, he didn't consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb.UyYet, looking to the promise of God, he didn't waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God,UOand being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.U:Therefore it also was "reckoned to him for righteousness."UGNow it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,Urbut for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead,UNwho was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.t(NUYBeing therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;Uxthrough whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.U`Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance;U?and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:UÉand hope doesn't disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.UJFor while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.UoFor one will hardly die for a righteous man. Yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die.U_But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.U`Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God's wrath through him.UëFor if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.U|Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.UÑTherefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, because all sinned.UUFor until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law.UùNevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren't like Adam's disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come.U«But the free gift isn't like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.UîThe gift is not as through one who sinned: for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification.U For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.UÇSo then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life.UàFor as through the one man's disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous.UqThe law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly;U|that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.t(NUHWhat shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?UHMay it never be! We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer?U_Or don't you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?UµWe were buried therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.UmFor if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;Uïknowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin.U,For he who has died has been freed from sin.UGBut if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him;Ucknowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!UaFor the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.U[Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.UXTherefore don't let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.U∂Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.UTFor sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace.UXWhat then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be!U´Don't you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?UõBut thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered.UCBeing made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness.UÔI speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification.ULFor when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.U{What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.UåBut now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life.UaFor the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.t(NUÄOr don't you know, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?UóFor the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.U€So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.U»Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.UÉFor when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.U•But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.U»What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn't have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn't have known coveting, unless the law had said, "You shall not covet."U}But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.U\I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.UBThe commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;UYfor sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.UTTherefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.UﬁDid then that which is good become death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.UHFor we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.UgFor I don't know what I am doing. For I don't practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.ULBut if what I don't desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.U>So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.UèFor I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don't find it doing that which is good.U\For the good which I desire, I don't do; but the evil which I don't desire, that I practice.U^But if what I don't desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.UMI find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.U0For I delight in God's law after the inward man,Uòbut I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.ULWhat a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?UI thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I myself serve God's law, but with the flesh, the sin's law.t(NUåThere is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don't walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.U`For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.U≠For what the law couldn't do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;Ukthat the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.UõFor those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.UQFor the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;Usbecause the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to God's law, neither indeed can it be.U,Those who are in the flesh can't please God.U¢But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any man doesn't have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.UgIf Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.U≈But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.UMSo then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.UzFor if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.UGFor as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God.UÑFor you didn't receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, "Abba! Father!"UIThe Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;Uçand if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.UÜFor I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.UUFor the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.UkFor the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hopeUthat the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.USFor we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.U•Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.UcFor we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?UIBut if we hope for that which we don't see, we wait for it with patience.UπIn the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don't know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can't be uttered.U}He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.UxWe know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.UÜFor whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.UWhom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified.USWhat then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?U{He who didn't spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?ULWho could bring a charge against God's chosen ones? It is God who justifies.UùWho is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.UâWho shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?UpEven as it is written, "For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter."UNNo, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.UÖFor I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,Uànor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.t(NU`I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,U8that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.UtFor I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers' sake, my relatives according to the flesh,Uzwho are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;Uvof whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.UmBut it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.UjNeither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children. But, "In Isaac will your seed be called."U|That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.U^For this is a word of promise, "At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son."UDNot only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.U†For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,U7it was said to her, "The elder will serve the younger."U9Even as it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."UKWhat shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!UuFor he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."URSo then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.U≤For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."UISo then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.UUYou will say then to me, "Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?"UÇBut indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?"U}Or hasn't the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?UÜWhat if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,Uqand that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,ULus, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?U{As he says also in Hosea, "I will call them 'my people,' which were not my people; and her 'beloved,' who was not beloved."Uä"It will be that in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' There they will be called 'children of the living God.'"UâIsaiah cries concerning Israel, "If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved;Uwfor He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth."UìAs Isaiah has said before, "Unless the Lord of Armies had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah."UñWhat shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn't follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;U^but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn't arrive at the law of righteousness.UvWhy? Because they didn't seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;Uåeven as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed."t(NUWBrothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.UWFor I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.UòFor being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn't subject themselves to the righteousness of God.UTFor Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.U_For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, "The one who does them will live by them."UåBut the righteousness which is of faith says this, "Don't say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down);UTor, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)"U|But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;" that is, the word of faith, which we preach:Uåthat if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.UjFor with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.UKFor the Scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed."UxFor there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.U?For, "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved."UúHow then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?U∞And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!"UbBut they didn't all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"U:So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.UÇBut I say, didn't they hear? Yes, most certainly, "Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world."U™But I ask, didn't Israel know? First Moses says, "I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry."UxIsaiah is very bold, and says, "I was found by those who didn't seek me. I was revealed to those who didn't ask for me."UgBut as to Israel he says, "All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."t(NUÜI ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.UèGod didn't reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don't you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:Uv"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."UrBut how does God answer him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."U]Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.U£And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.U{What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn't obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.UîAccording as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day."UgDavid says, "Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.UOLet their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always."UñI ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.UvNow if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?UfFor I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;U\if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.UuFor if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?UUIf the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.U∂But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;Uodon't boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.UJYou will say then, "Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."UhTrue; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don't be conceited, but fear;UHfor if God didn't spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.U™See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.UpThey also, if they don't continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.U·For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?U“For I don't desire you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,Uëand so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, "There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.U?This is my covenant to them, when I will take away their sins."U~Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.U5For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.UcFor as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,Uheven so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.UIFor God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.UäOh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!UH"For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?"UD"Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to him again?"U\For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.t(NUõTherefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.U¢Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.U›For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.U_For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don't have the same function,UUso we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.UäHaving gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;UQor service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;Uñor he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.UULet love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.UaIn love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;U>not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;UJrejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;U>contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.U6Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don't curse.U9Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.UéBe of the same mind one toward another. Don't set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don't be wise in your own conceits.UNRepay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.UHIf it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.UëDon't seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath. For it is written, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord."UåTherefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head."U7Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.t(NUéLet every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those who exist are ordained by God.UÖTherefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance of God; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment.U≠For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same,U∆for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn't bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil.UeTherefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake.UuFor this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God's service, attending continually on this very thing.UåGive therefore to everyone what you owe: taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor.UeOwe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.T#  For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," "You shall not give false testimony," "You shall not covet," and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."UKLove doesn't harm a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.UëDo this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed.UÅThe night is far gone, and the day is near. Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let's put on the armor of light.UëLet us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy.UUBut put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.t(NUHNow accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions.UMOne man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables.UDon't let him who eats despise him who doesn't eat. Don't let him who doesn't eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him.UêWho are you who judge another's servant? To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand, for God has power to make him stand.UzOne man esteems one day as more important. Another esteems every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.U¯He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn't eat, to the Lord he doesn't eat, and gives God thanks.U:For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.UvFor if we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord's.UjFor to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.UêBut you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.UoFor it is written, "'As I live,' says the Lord, 'to me every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess to God.'"U;So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.UöTherefore let's not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way, or an occasion for falling.UùI know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.UÇYet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love. Don't destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.U&Then don't let your good be slandered,Uhfor the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.URFor he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.UjSo then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up.UëDon't overthrow God's work for food's sake. All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating.UuIt is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made weak.UsDo you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who doesn't judge himself in that which he approves.T6  But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isn't of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin. (14:24) Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages, (14:25) but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations; (14:26) to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.t(NU\Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.UULet each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up.UvFor even Christ didn't please himself. But, as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me."UúFor whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.UyNow the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus,U`that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.UTTherefore accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you, to the glory of God.UêNow I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,Uôand that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name."U8Again he says, "Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people."UKAgain, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles! Let all the peoples praise him."U~Again, Isaiah says, "There will be the root of Jesse, he who arises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles will hope."UÉNow may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.UïI myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.UoBut I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God,U√that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest the Good News of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.UII have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.UåFor I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,U™in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God's Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;UÇyes, making it my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build on another's foundation.UlBut, as it is written, "They will see, to whom no news of him came.

Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?UBI thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,UCso that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.Uf(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether I baptized any other.)UäFor Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News--not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn't be made void.UpFor the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.UvFor it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing."U|Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?U≤For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.U1For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,UUbut we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,Udbut to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.U_Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.UwFor you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;Uªbut God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;Uüand God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:U&that no flesh should boast before God.U~But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:UMthat, according as it is written, "He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."t(NU|When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.UXFor I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.U;I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.UyMy speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,UMthat your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.UïWe speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.UÄBut we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,Uxwhich none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of glory.U®But as it is written, "Things which an eye didn't see, and an ear didn't hear, which didn't enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him."UqBut to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.UôFor who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's Spirit.UíBut we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.UôWhich things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.U†Now the natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can't know them, because they are spiritually discerned.UPBut he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.Ua"For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we have Christ's mind.t(NU]Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.UbI fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,Uófor you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk in the ways of men?UXFor when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," aren't you fleshly?UoWho then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?U6I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.U]So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.UrNow he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.UGFor we are God's fellow workers. You are God's farming, God's building.U≠According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.U]For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.U_But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;U¢each man's work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is.UIIf any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.UdIf any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.UPDon't you know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?UdIf anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are.UÖLet no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.UuFor the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He has taken the wise in their craftiness."ULAnd again, "The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless."U<Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,Uzwhether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come.

Then each man will get his praise from God.U‡Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another.UïFor who makes you different? And what do you have that you didn't receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?UüYou are already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.U°For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.UÇWe are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong.

Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.t(NUaNow concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.UmBut, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.UeLet the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.UïThe wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but the wife.U“Don't deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of self-control.U8But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.U}Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.UZBut I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.U[But if they don't have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to burn.UVBut to the married I command--not I, but the Lord--that the wife not leave her husbandU~(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.UâBut to the rest I--not the Lord--say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.UlThe woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband.UÆFor the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.UïYet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.U|For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?U{Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the assemblies.UíWas anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.UcCircumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.U9Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called.UuWere you called being a bondservant? Don't let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it.UåFor he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant.U?You were bought with a price. Don't become bondservants of men.U]Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.UíNow concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.UsI think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is.U]Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don't seek a wife.UîBut if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.UxBut I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;Uóand those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn't rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn't possess;Udand those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.UàBut I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;U]but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.U¸There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world--how she may please her husband.UóThis I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.U«But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn't sin. Let them marry.UÉBut he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well.UtSo then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn't give her in marriage does better.UòA wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord.UeBut she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit.t(NUvNow concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.UUBut if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn't yet know as he ought to know.U2But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.UïTherefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.UÇFor though there are things that are called "gods," whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many "gods" and many "lords;"U°yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.U¥However, that knowledge isn't in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.UwBut food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don't eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.U`But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.UõFor if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?U\And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.UjThus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.UzTherefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don't cause my brother to stumble.t(NUjAm I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren't you my work in the Lord?UoIf to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.U+My defense to those who examine me is this.U%Have we no right to eat and to drink?UÑHave we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?U1Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?U†What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn't eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn't drink from the flock's milk?UaDo I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn't the law also say the same thing?UÖFor it is written in the law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain." Is it for the oxen that God cares,UØor does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope.UXIf we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?U∑If others partake of this right over you, don't we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ.UûDon't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?U_Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.UÆBut I have used none of these things, and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void.UçFor if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don't preach the Good News.UrFor if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.U¢What then is my reward? That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.UbFor though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.UóTo the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;Uôto those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law.UÅTo the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.URNow I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it.UqDon't you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may win.UêEvery man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.UYI therefore run like that, as not uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air,UÅbut I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.t(NUwNow I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;U=and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;U$and all ate the same spiritual food;Uwand all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.U`However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.UlNow these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.UzNeither be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."UnNeither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.USNeither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.UNNeither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.UäNow all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.UGTherefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn't fall.UÂNo temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.U*Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.U)I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say.UíThe cup of blessing which we bless, isn't it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn't it a sharing of the body of Christ?UpBecause there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread.UdConsider Israel according to the flesh. Don't those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?UaWhat am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?U†But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don't desire that you would have fellowship with demons.UåYou can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.U?Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?U"All things are lawful for me," but not all things are profitable. "All things are lawful for me," but not all things build up.U:Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor's good.UYWhatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,U0for "the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness."U®But if one of those who don't believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.UøBut if anyone says to you, "This was offered to idols," don't eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For "the earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness."UpConscience, I say, not your own, but the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?UTIf I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?UTWhether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.UYGive no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God;U{even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.t(NU0Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.U~Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.UÑBut I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.UNEvery man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.UâBut every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.UÇFor if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.UÖFor a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.U.For man is not from woman, but woman from man;UAfor neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.UTFor this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.UmNevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.U]For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.UJJudge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?UZDoesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?U`But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.U\But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God's assemblies.UpBut in giving you this command, I don't praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.UyFor first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.UaFor there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.UZWhen therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.U^For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.U¬What, don't you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to shame who don't have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don't praise you.UÜFor I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.UÄWhen he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me."UòIn the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me."UdFor as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.UëTherefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.UUBut let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.U|For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn't discern the Lord's body.UGFor this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.U5For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn't be judged.UaBut when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.ULTherefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another.UÜBut if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come.t(NUKNow concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant.UeYou know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.UñTherefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, "Jesus is accursed." No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," but by the Holy Spirit.U:Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.U6There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.USThere are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.UOBut to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.U~For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;U[to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;Uºand to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.UfBut the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.U{For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.UêFor in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.U)For the body is not one member, but many.UvIf the foot would say, "Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body," it is not therefore not part of the body.UsIf the ear would say, "Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body," it's not therefore not part of the body.UrIf the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?USBut now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.U5If they were all one member, where would the body be?U,But now they are many members, but one body.UoThe eye can't tell the hand, "I have no need for you," or again the head to the feet, "I have no need for you."UQNo, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.UûThose parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;UÖwhereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,Umthat there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.UxWhen one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.U9Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.U¥God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.UNAre all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?UUDo all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?URBut earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.t(NU|If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don't have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.U†If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.U|If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don't have love, it profits me nothing.UPLove is patient and is kind; love doesn't envy. Love doesn't brag, is not proud,Ukdoesn't behave itself inappropriately, doesn't seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;U@doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;ULbears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.U∑Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.U-For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;U\but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.UèWhen I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things.UâFor now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.UQBut now faith, hope, and love remain--these three. The greatest of these is love.t(NU^Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.UÉFor he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.UXBut he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation.U^He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.UﬂNow I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.U¬But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?UüEven things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?UNFor if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?UïSo also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.U`There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning.UÜIf then I don't know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.UtSo also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.ULTherefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.UWFor if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.U§What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.U¶Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the "Amen" at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you say?UNFor you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.U?I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.UûHowever in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.U\Brothers, don't be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.U°In the law it is written, "By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord."U¨Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.U©If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won't they say that you are crazy?UsBut if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.UâAnd thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.UÕWhat is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up.UoIf any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.UnBut if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God.UALet the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.UMBut if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.UQFor you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.U8The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,UXfor God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,Uìlet your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says.UÖIf they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly.UQWhat? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?UñIf any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.U/But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.UbTherefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don't forbid speaking with other languages.U-Let all things be done decently and in order.t(NUxNow I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,Unby which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you--unless you believed in vain.UzFor I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,UTthat he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,U3and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.UxThen he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep.U4Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,UPand last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also.UxFor I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God.U±But by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.U@Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.UÜNow if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?ULBut if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.U]If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.U•Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn't raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised.U>For if the dead aren't raised, neither has Christ been raised.UNIf Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.U=Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.UNIf we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.UaBut now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.UKFor since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.UAFor as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.U_But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ's, at his coming.UíThen the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.UBFor he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.U/The last enemy that will be abolished is death.UØFor, "He put all things in subjection under his feet." But when he says, "All things are put in subjection," it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.UõWhen all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.UÉOr else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren't raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?U,Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?UTI affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.UùIf I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."U=Don't be deceived! "Evil companionships corrupt good morals."U`Wake up righteously, and don't sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.U\But someone will say, "How are the dead raised?" and, "With what kind of body do they come?"UNYou foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.UqThat which you sow, you don't sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.USBut God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.UÄAll flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.U}There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.UäThere is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.U`So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.U]It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.UuIt is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.UnSo also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living soul." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.UeHowever that which is spiritual isn't first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.UTThe first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.UÉAs is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.U\As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let's also bear the image of the heavenly.U~Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can't inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.UPBehold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,Uúin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.UWFor this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.U¨But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: "Death is swallowed up in victory."U;"Death, where is your sting? Hades, where is your victory?"U;The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.UMBut thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.UöTherefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.t(NUhNow concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.UsOn the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.UeWhen I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.U=If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.U`But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.UjBut with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.UfFor I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.U+But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,UPfor a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.UkNow if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.UäTherefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.U∂Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.U9Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!U$Let all that you do be done in love.UòNow I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),UYthat you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.UwI rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.UVFor they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.UÖThe assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.U?All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.U/This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.UOIf any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come, Lord!U/The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.U,My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.ttq/(U2 Corinthians(NU≤Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:UEGrace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.UeBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;U®who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.U^For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.U√But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.UwOur hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort.UŒFor we don't desire to have you uninformed, brothers, concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life.UâYes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,U|who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;U•you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.U“For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.UxFor we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;Uxas also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.U`In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;UÅand by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea.UΩWhen I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the "Yes, yes" and the "No, no?"UABut as God is faithful, our word toward you was not "Yes and no."UåFor the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not "Yes and no," but in him is "Yes."UàFor however many are the promises of God, in him is the "Yes." Therefore also through him is the "Amen," to the glory of God through us.UFNow he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;UMwho also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.UTBut I call God for a witness to my soul, that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you.UuNot that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in faith.t(NUOBut I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.USFor if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?UøAnd I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.U∂For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.UuBut if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.ULSufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;Uïso that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.U4Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.UiFor to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.UúNow I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,UYthat no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.UcNow when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,UI had no relief for my spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.UáNow thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.U[For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;Uzto the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?UÅFor we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.t(NUsAre we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?UEYou are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;Uºbeing revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.U2Such confidence we have through Christ toward God;Upnot that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;Uëwho also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.UÀBut if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:U4won't service of the Spirit be with much more glory?UfFor if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.UáFor most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.UWFor if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.U>Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,Uéand not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away.UíBut their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in Christ it passes away.U@But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.U;But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.UQNow the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.U™But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.t(NURTherefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we don't faint.U‡But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.UBEven if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;U±in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.UhFor we don't preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake;UØseeing it is God who said, "Light will shine out of darkness," who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.U{But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.UMWe are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;U:pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;U|always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.UFor we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.U+So then death works in us, but life in you.UõBut having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, "I believed, and therefore I spoke." We also believe, and therefore also we speak;Ufknowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.UèFor all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.UkTherefore we don't faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.UuFor our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;U≤while we don't look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.t(NUíFor we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.UdFor most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;U7if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.U≥For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.UbNow he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.UoTherefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;U#for we walk by faith, not by sight.UrWe are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.UYTherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him.U•For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.UéKnowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences.UƒFor we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart.UYFor if we are beside ourselves, it is for God. Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.UgFor the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.U}He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.UáTherefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.U|Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new.U|But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;Uünamely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.UåWe are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.UqFor him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.t(NUPWorking together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,U§for he says, "At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you." Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.UQWe give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,U|but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,UNin beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;UYin pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,Ukin the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,URby glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;U[as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;Utas sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.U=Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged.ULYou are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.U@Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.UãDon't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?UYWhat agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?U«What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people."UtTherefore, "'Come out from among them, and be separate,' says the Lord. 'Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you.UZI will be to you a Father. You will be to me sons and daughters,' says the Lord Almighty."t(NUìHaving therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.U\Open your hearts to us. We wronged no one. We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one.UtI say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.UîGreat is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.UêFor even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side. Fightings were outside. Fear was inside.URNevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;UΩand not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more.UôFor though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while.U≠I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.UpFor godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret. But the sorrow of the world works death.UÒFor behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.UƒSo although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God.UôTherefore we have been comforted. In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.U¬For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.UÑHis affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.UAI rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.t(NUnMoreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;UÇhow that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.UcFor according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,Udbegging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints.UrThis was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.UcSo we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.UëBut as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace.UtI speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.UùFor you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.UâI give a judgment in this: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.UàBut now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.UqFor if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don't have.U<For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,U£but for equality. Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.UgAs it is written, "He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack."UUBut thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.UmFor he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.UmWe have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies.U≠Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.UiWe are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us.UdHaving regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.U¨We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.UåAs for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.UmTherefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.t(NUUIt is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,U´for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.UåBut I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,U´so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.UÔI thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.UrRemember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.UÉLet each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.UÜAnd God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.UiAs it is written, "He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever."UñNow may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;U_you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.UêFor this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;U∆seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;U{while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.U.Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!t(NU§Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you.U∞Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.UJFor though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war according to the flesh;Uofor the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,U£throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;UYand being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full.U“Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ's, so also we are Christ's.U´For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,U@that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.UtFor, "His letters," they say, "are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised."UÜLet such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.U€For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.U~But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you.UäFor we don't stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn't reach to you. For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ,U§not boasting beyond proper limits in other men's labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,Uoso as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done.U/But "he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."UQFor it isn't he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.t(NU[I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me.UáFor I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.UîBut I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.U‹For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different "good news", which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough.U@For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles.UÜBut though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not unskilled in knowledge. No, in every way we have been revealed to you in all things.U}Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God's Good News free of charge?UII robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might serve you.UÛWhen I was present with you and was in need, I wasn't a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need. In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so.UaAs the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia.U)Why? Because I don't love you? God knows.UïBut what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we.UVFor such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ's apostles.U?And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.UàIt is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.UoI say again, let no one think me foolish. But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little.UoThat which I speak, I don't speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.U:Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast.U1For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise.UòFor you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face.U~I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.U_Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.U¨Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.U<Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one.UÉThree times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck. I have been a night and a day in the deep.U’I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;Umin labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness.UoBesides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the assemblies.U\Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I don't burn with indignation?UEIf I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.UcThe God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I don't lie.UhIn Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to arrest me.UOThrough a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.t(NUgIt is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.U∞I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don't know, or whether out of the body, I don't know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.UYI know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don't know; God knows),Ukhow he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.UeOn behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.U∂For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.U‹By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.URConcerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.U√He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.UûTherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.U≠I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.UkTruly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.UõFor what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.UﬂBehold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.UiI will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?UZBut be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.UFDid I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?UúI exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him.

Amen.UpI marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different "good news";Uvand there isn't another "good news." Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.UéBut even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any "good news" other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.UçAs we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any "good news" other than that which you received, let him be cursed.UñFor am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn't be a servant of Christ.UvBut I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.UqFor neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.UîFor you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.UêI advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.UrBut when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,Uvto reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn't immediately confer with flesh and blood,U|nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.U_Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.UIBut of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord's brother.UMNow about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I'm not lying.U0Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.ULI was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,Ufbut they only heard: "He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy."UAnd they glorified God in me.t(NUlThen after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.U∆I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.UTBut not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.U•This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;U|to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you.UøBut from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn't show partiality to man)--they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,Uùbut to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcisionUf(for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles);UÓand when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.USThey only asked us to remember the poor--which very thing I was also zealous to do.UWBut when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned.U•For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.UrAnd the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.UˆBut when I saw that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, "If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?U3"We, being Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,T  yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.UÉBut if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!UUFor if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.UBFor I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God.U“I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.UkI don't make void the grace of God.

Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?USAre you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?U?Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?UâHe therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?ULEven as Abraham "believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."UMKnow therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.UßThe Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you all the nations will be blessed."UFSo then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.UΩFor as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who doesn't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them."UgNow that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, "The righteous will live by faith."UHThe law is not of faith, but, "The man who does them will live by them."UàChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,"Uåthat the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.UãBrothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.UêNow the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn't say, "To seeds," as of many, but as of one, "To your seed," which is Christ.UÆNow I say this. A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.UmFor if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.UµWhat then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.U2Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.UÆIs the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.UÇBut the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.UyBut before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.U`So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.U<But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.U?For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.UCFor as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.UãThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.UPIf you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.t(NUoBut I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;UJbut is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.UdSo we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.UbBut when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law,Ubthat he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children.UjAnd because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, "Abba, Father!"U`So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.U_However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods.U≈But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?U-You observe days, months, seasons, and years.U?I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.U\I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong,Ubbut you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.UåThat which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.UÖWhat was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.U;So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?U`They zealously seek you in no good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.U]But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.UQMy little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you--Uabut I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.UJTell me, you that desire to be under the law, don't you listen to the law?U\For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.UyHowever, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.UÑThese things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.UFor this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children.UGBut the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.U∞For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren who don't bear. Break forth and shout, you that don't travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband."U8Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.U{But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.UóHowever what does the Scripture say? "Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman."ULSo then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.t(NUzStand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.U[Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.UeYes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.UjYou are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law.

Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.U;I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.UãFor you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.U`For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."UVBut if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don't consume one another.UKBut I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh.U†For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.U<But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.UiNow the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,Ubidolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,Uøenvyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.UUBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,UBgentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.UPThose who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.U8If we live by the Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit.UKLet's not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.t(NUÆBrothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren't tempted.U=Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.UTFor if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.UcBut let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.U&For each man will bear his own burden.UQBut let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.UVDon't be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.UãFor he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption.

I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.U{For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,U¬according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.U0For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.UmBut if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't make known what I will choose.UkBut I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.U:Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.UxHaving this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,UXthat your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.UÂOnly let your manner of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;UÉand in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.UuBecause it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,UDhaving the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.t(NUìIf there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,U_make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;Uldoing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;U]each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.U7Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,UZwho, existing in the form of God, didn't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,UUbut emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.UkAnd being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.UZTherefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;Uothat at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,U_and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.U£So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.UOFor it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.U.Do all things without murmurings and disputes,UÆthat you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,UÇholding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn't run in vain nor labor in vain.UlYes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.U7In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.UvBut I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.UBFor I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.U<For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.UvBut you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.UNTherefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.U=But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.UãBut I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need;U[since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.UèFor indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.UÉI have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.UGReceive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,UÇbecause for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.t(NUÅFinally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.

For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,UÇfor indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound more and more;Uëand that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we instructed you;UVthat you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.UíBut we don't want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you don't grieve like the rest, who have no hope.UxFor if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.U°For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.UòFor the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,Uöthen we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.U/Therefore comfort one another with these words.t(NUeBut concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.UVFor you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.UûFor when they are saying, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.UUBut you, brothers, aren't in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.UfYou are all children of light, and children of the day. We don't belong to the night, nor to darkness,UFso then let's not sleep, as the rest do, but let's watch and be sober.UXFor those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.UâBut let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.UdFor God didn't appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,URwho died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.UKTherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.UlBut we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,UZand to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake.

Today have I become your father?" and again,  "I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son?"UgAgain, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says, "Let all the angels of God worship him."UVOf the angels he says, "Who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire."U|But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.UâYou have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows."UmAnd, "You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands.UOThey will perish, but you continue. They all will grow old like a garment does.UnAs a mantle, you will roll them up, and they will be changed; but you are the same. Your years will not fail."U~But which of the angels has he told at any time, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?"UiAren't they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?t(NUfTherefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.U|For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;Uñhow will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation--which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;UêGod also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?UFFor he didn't subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.UwBut one has somewhere testified, saying, "What is man, that you think of him? Or the son of man, that you care for him?URYou made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor.U≈You have put all things in subjection under his feet." For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don't see all things subjected to him, yet.U«But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.U≤For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.UÇFor both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,Ulsaying, "I will declare your name to my brothers. In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise."UhAgain, "I will put my trust in him." Again, "Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me."UÃSince then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,Ucand might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.U]For most certainly, he doesn't give help to angels, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.U Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.U\For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.t(NUyTherefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;UNwho was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.UzFor he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house.UHFor every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.U{Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,Uêbut Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.ULTherefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,  "Today if you will hear his voice,Ucdon't harden your hearts, as in the provocation, like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,UMwhere your fathers tested me by proving me, and saw my works for forty years.UzTherefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, 'They always err in their heart, but they didn't know my ways;'U<as I swore in my wrath, 'They will not enter into my rest.'"UyBeware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;UÄbut exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called "today;" lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.UhFor we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:Udwhile it is said, "Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion."UXFor who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?UnWith whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?U_To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?U?We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.t(NUxLet us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.U™For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn't profit them, because it wasn't mixed with faith by those who heard.U≈For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;" although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.UiFor he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, "God rested on the seventh day from all his works;"U<and in this place again, "They will not enter into my rest."UöSeeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,U´he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), "Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts."UUFor if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.U=There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.UaFor he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.UqLet us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.U‚For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.UäThere is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.UÇHaving then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.U¢For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.UàLet us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need.t(NUöFor every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.UÇThe high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.UZBecause of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.UQNobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.UëSo also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, "You are my Son. Today I have become your father."U]As he says also in another place, "You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."U∏He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,UKthough he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.UaHaving been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,U:named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.UcAbout him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.UŒFor when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.UaFor everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.UzBut solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.t(NU≤Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection--not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,Uiof the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.U This will we do, if God permits.U{For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,UCand tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,Uõand then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.U•For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;Uebut if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.U}But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.U•For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them.UcWe desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,Uithat you won't be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises.UbFor when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,UPsaying, "Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you."U8Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.UiFor men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.UèIn this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;U¨that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.U{This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;Uowhere as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.t(NUàFor this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,Uùto whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;U°without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.UnNow consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils.U‘They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham,U{but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.U=But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.UhHere people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives.UPWe can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,UBfor he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him.UÒNow if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?UVFor the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.UmFor he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.UuFor it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.UfThis is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,Ufwho has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:UWfor it is testified, "You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."U\For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessnessUj(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.U@Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oathUÿ(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him, "The Lord swore and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'"UABy so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant.UYMany, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death.UBBut he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.UñTherefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.UÄFor such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;Uøwho doesn't need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.UúFor the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected.t(NU¶Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,UXa servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.UîFor every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.U|For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;UÎwho serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, "See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."UûBut now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.UaFor if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.U§For finding fault with them, he said, "Behold, the days come," says the Lord, "that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;U›not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn't continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them," says the Lord.U„"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those days," says the Lord; "I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their heart. I will be their God, and they will be my people.U´They will not teach every man his fellow citizen, and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.UgFor I will be merciful to their unrighteousness. I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more."UÜIn that he says, "A new covenant," he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.t(NU^Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.UÉFor a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place.ULAfter the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,U≈having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;Ujand above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can't speak now in detail.UÄNow these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,Uébut into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.UáThe Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;Uùwhich is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;Upbeing only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.UÆBut Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,Uönor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.UéFor if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:UØhow much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?UÒFor this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.U`For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.UgFor a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.UGTherefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.UÈFor when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,UHsaying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you."UgMoreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the blood.UwAccording to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.U¨It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.UßFor Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;U~nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,U≠or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.UJInasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,U¢so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.t(NUƒFor the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.UíOr else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?U9But in those sacrifices there is yearly reminder of sins.UMFor it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.U{Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, "Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire, but you prepared a body for me;UDYou had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.UkThen I said, 'Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.'"UæPreviously saying, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn't desire, neither had pleasure in them" (those which are offered according to the law),Usthen he has said, "Behold, I have come to do your will." He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,Udby which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.UuEvery priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,U^but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;ULfrom that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.ULFor by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.U7The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,UÆ"This is the covenant that I will make with them: 'After those days,' says the Lord, 'I will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;'" then he says,U:"I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more."UCNow where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.UXHaving therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,Uhby the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;U0and having a great priest over the house of God,Uòlet's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,U^let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful.UBLet us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,Uïnot forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching.UvFor if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,Ujbut a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.U^A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses.UÓHow much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?U|For we know him who said, "Vengeance belongs to me," says the Lord, "I will repay." Again, "The Lord will judge his people."U?It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.UqBut remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;Uxpartly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so.U∆For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens.UCTherefore don't throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.UYFor you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.UC"In a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait.UZBut the righteous will live by faith. If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him."UnBut we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.t(NUENow faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen.U+For by this, the elders obtained testimony.UïBy faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible.U›By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks.U‘By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn't see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God.U†Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.U„By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.UòBy faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went.U°By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.UUFor he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.UïBy faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised.U§Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.UµThese all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.UYFor those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.UuIf indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return.U°But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.UÖBy faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son;UAeven he to whom it was said, "In Isaac will your seed be called;"U~concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.UGBy faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.UwBy faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.UçBy faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones.U≤By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.UZBy faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,Uhchoosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;Ujaccounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.UkBy faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.U{By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.UtBy faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.UWBy faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.UrBy faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn't perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.UÄWhat more shall I say? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;Unwho, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,Uëquenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee.UèWomen received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.UTOthers were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment.UµThey were stoned. They were sawn apart. They were tempted. They were slain with the sword. They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treatedUg(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.U^These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn't receive the promise,UkGod having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.t(NUœTherefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,UΩlooking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.UÇFor consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don't grow weary, fainting in your souls.U9You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;UØand you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children, "My son, don't take lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him;UOFor whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives."UÑIt is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn't discipline?UvBut if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children.U£Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?UÖFor they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.U©All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.UATherefore, lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,Uiand make straight paths for your feet, so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.U_Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,Uùlooking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;Unlest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.U∞For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.UxFor you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,UÄthe sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,Upfor they could not stand that which was commanded, "If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned;"USand so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."UÑBut you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,Uìto the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,Unto Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.U¡See that you don't refuse him who speaks. For if they didn't escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,Uâwhose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."U™This phrase, "Yet once more," signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.UÜTherefore, receiving a Kingdom that can't be shaken, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,U for our God is a consuming fire.t(NULet brotherly love continue.UpDon't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing it.UsRemember those who are in bonds, as bound with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.U~Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled: but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.UõBe free from the love of money, content with such things as you have, for he has said, "I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way forsake you."UbSo that with good courage we say, "The Lord is my helper. I will not fear. What can man do to me?"URemember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God, and considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith.U7Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.U∏Don't be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.UUWe have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat.UñFor the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp.UlTherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.UILet us therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach.UKFor we don't have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to come.UéThrough him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name.U\But don't forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.UÃObey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you.UkPray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.UEI strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you sooner.UêNow may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,U∞make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever.

Revelation(NUµThis is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, John,U`who testified to God's word, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw.UäBlessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is at hand.UÆJohn, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from God, who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;UØand from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.

Having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.UãAnd among the lampstands was one like a son of man, clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.U^His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.UxHis feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.UçHe had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.UàWhen I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He laid his right hand on me, saying, "Don't be afraid. I am the first and the last,Upand the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. I have the keys of Death and of Hades.UuWrite therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;U¬the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands.

Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throneUqthat looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.UöAround the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.UôOut of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.UµBefore the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.UûThe first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.U„The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!"UyWhen the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,U°the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,U∏"Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One, to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created!"t(NUwI saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.UmI saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?"UiNo one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it.UTAnd I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look in it.U¶One of the elders said to me, "Don't weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals."UıI saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.UPThen he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.UŒNow when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.UƒThey sang a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the book, and to open its seals: for you were killed, and bought us for God with your blood, out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,UFand made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign on earth."U»I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;Uésaying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!"U¸I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, "To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen!"UKThe four living creatures said, "Amen!" The elders fell down and worshiped.t(NUìI saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, "Come and see!"UÇAnd behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him, and he came forth conquering, and to conquer.URWhen he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come!"U∞Another came forth, a red horse. To him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword.U£When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, "Come and see!" And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.UµI heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don't damage the oil and the wine!"UZWhen he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, "Come and see!"UÏAnd behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it, his name was Death. Hades followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him.UßWhen he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony of the Lamb which they had.UíThey cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"U‹A long white robe was given to each of them. They were told that they should rest yet for a while, until their fellow servants and their brothers, who would also be killed even as they were, should complete their course.UöI saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.UsThe stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.UqThe sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.U≥The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.UåThey told the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,UCfor the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?"t(NUµAfter this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.U±I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,UÑsaying, "Don't harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!"UÇI heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:Uof the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,Uzof the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,Uwof the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,UÜof the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.T   After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.UiThey cried with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"UùAll the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his throne, and worshiped God,Uusaying, "Amen! Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might, be to our God forever and ever! Amen."U}One of the elders answered, saying to me, "These who are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and from where did they come?"U©I told him, "My lord, you know." He said to me, "These are those who came out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb's blood.UòTherefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them.UeThey will never be hungry, neither thirsty any more; neither will the sun beat on them, nor any heat;Uüfor the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them, and leads them to springs of waters of life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."t(NUTWhen he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.USI saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.UÀAnother angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.UeThe smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.U¢The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.UIThe seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.U⁄The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.UÅThe second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,Uhand one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed.UúThe third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.UîThe name of the star is called "Wormwood." One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter.UÒThe fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn't shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.U’I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!"t(NUáThe fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.U≠He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.U}Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.UØThey were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don't have God's seal on their foreheads.UòThey were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a person.UyIn those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.UòThe shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people's faces.UJThey had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.UåThey had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.UpThey have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.U~They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon," but in Greek, he has the name "Apollyon."UJThe first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.U`The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,Uqsaying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, "Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!"UàThe four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind.U]The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million. I heard the number of them.U–Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.UÖBy these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.UèFor the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.T  The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn't repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn't worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.UqThey didn't repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.t(NUüI saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.UbHe had in his hand a little open book. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land.UdHe cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.U©When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and don't write them."U\The angel who I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky,U÷and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be delay,U†but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants, the prophets.U§The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me, said, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land."U∑I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. He said to me, "Take it, and eat it up. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."UïI took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.UYThey told me, "You must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."t(NU}A reed like a rod was given to me. Someone said, "Rise, and measure God's temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.UÆLeave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don't measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.UyI will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."U\These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing before the Lord of the earth.UöIf anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way.UﬁThese have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.UåWhen they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.UåTheir dead bodies will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.U≤From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.UÆThose who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they will be glad. They will give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.UîAfter the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them.UÉI heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here!" They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.UæIn that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.U<The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe comes quickly.UπThe seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven followed, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!"UlThe twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God's throne, fell on their faces and worshiped God,UÜsaying: "We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was; because you have taken your great power, and reigned.T  The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their reward, as well as to the saints, and those who fear your name, to the small and the great; and to destroy those who destroy the earth."U´God's temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of the Lord's covenant was seen in his temple. Lightnings, sounds, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail followed.t(NUÑA great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.UBShe was with child. She cried out in pain, laboring to give birth.U}Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.U√His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.UåShe gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.UèThe woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days.UlThere was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war.UJThey didn't prevail, neither was a place found for him any more in heaven.UƒThe great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.UI heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now is come the salvation, the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night.UÜThey overcame him because of the Lamb's blood, and because of the word of their testimony. They didn't love their life, even to death.U∫Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time."UsWhen the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.UœTwo wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.UÅThe serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.UThe earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.UëThe dragon grew angry with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep God's commandments and hold Jesus' testimony.t(NU±Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names.UπThe beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.UÄOne of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast.UßThey worshiped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"UzA mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority to make war for forty-two months was given to him.UrHe opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven.UëIt was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him.U´All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed.U#If anyone has an ear, let him hear.UñIf anyone has captivity, he will go into captivity. If anyone is with the sword, he must be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.UiI saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.U©He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.UgHe performs great signs, even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people.UËHe deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived.UæIt was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast to be killed.UôHe causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands, or on their foreheads;Uzand that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.UòHere is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six.t(NU¥I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.U¨I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.U“They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.U“These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.U8In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.UüI saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people.U∂He said with a loud voice, "Fear the Lord, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!"U•Another, a second angel, followed, saying, "Babylon the great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality."U£Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand,U’he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.U´The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.UdHere is the patience of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."U»I heard the voice from heaven saying, "Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'" "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them."UóI looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.U∆Another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, "Send forth your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!"UQHe who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.UVAnother angel came out from the temple which is in heaven. He also had a sharp sickle.T  Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Send forth your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth's grapes are fully ripe!"UçThe angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.U£The winepress was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out from the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.t(NUÉI saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God's wrath is finished.U∞I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who overcame the beast, his image, and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God.U They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God, the Almighty! Righteous and true are your ways, you King of the nations.U≠Who wouldn't fear you, Lord, and glorify your name? For you only are holy. For all the nations will come and worship before you. For your righteous acts have been revealed."UdAfter these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.UÖThe seven angels who had the seven plagues came out, clothed with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes around their breasts.UÇOne of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.U¥The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power. No one was able to enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished.t(NUáI heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!"UßThe first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast, and who worshiped his image.U|The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died.UZThe third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.UÖI heard the angel of the waters saying, "You are righteous, who are and who were, you Holy One, because you have judged these things.UyFor they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve this."U_I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments."U[The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire.UòPeople were scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues. They didn't repent and give him glory.UÜThe fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,Upand they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores. They didn't repent of their works.U£The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrise.UßI saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;U∑for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of that great day of God, the Almighty.Uá"Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothes, so that he doesn't walk naked, and they see his shame."ULHe gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew, Megiddo.UâThe seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"U§There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.U…The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.U9Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.U≥Great hailstones, about the weight of a talent, came down out of the sky on people. People blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for this plague is exceedingly severe.t(NU©One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,Uôwith whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality."U£He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.U–The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth.UâAnd on her forehead a name was written, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."UíI saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.U£The angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.T4  The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction. Those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is not, and shall be present.U_Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.UThey are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little while.UkThe beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.UêThe ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.UJThese have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.U∏These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. They also will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful."UuHe said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.UΩThe ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and will make her desolate, and will make her naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.U®For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.UTThe woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth."t(NUÖAfter these things, I saw another angel coming down out of the sky, having great authority. The earth was illuminated with his glory.U»He cried with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons, a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird!U⁄For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury."UûI heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, that you have no participation in her sins, and that you don't receive of her plagues,ULfor her sins have reached to the sky, and God has remembered her iniquities.UèReturn to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she did, and according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to her double.UºHowever much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, 'I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way see mourning.'U°Therefore in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong.UùThe kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her, will weep and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of her burning,Uîstanding far away for the fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For your judgment has come in one hour.'U_The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise any more;U–merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory, every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;Uâand cinnamon, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, and people's bodies and souls.U´The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you will find them no more at all.UÄThe merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;Uèsaying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls!UÆFor in an hour such great riches are made desolate.' Every shipmaster, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away,U`and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What is like the great city?'U„They cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!' For in one hour is she made desolate.Uj"Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her."UªA mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all.U‰The voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. No craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you.UÓThe light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived.UcIn her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on the earth."t(NUöAfter these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation, power, and glory belong to our God:U¿for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has judged the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand."U@A second said, "Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever."UÑThe twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen! Hallelujah!"UÜA voice came forth from the throne, saying, "Give praise to our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great!"U¡I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!UñLet us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give the glory to him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready."UÖIt was given to her that she would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.UçHe said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'" He said to me, "These are true words of God."UÌI fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me, "Look! Don't do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy."UèI saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and makes war.UâHis eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many crowns.

Fire came down out of heaven from God, and devoured them.UØThe devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also.

There was found no place for them.UÒI saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the book of life.
